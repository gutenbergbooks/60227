<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“L</span>ook out, boys, or we shall never fetch the ship
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter enough; we’re ever so far from her, and
there’s a storm brewing. Just look to the westward
and see what a bank the sun is setting in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, a lurid, red sun was setting in a bank
of heavy, black clouds, which had already obscured
his lower half, and the surface of which was flecked
with little, white, fleecy dots, moving rapidly, which
looked as if the port-holes of some giant craft had
been opened and her guns fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an open boat were I, Sam Hawse, and the two
speakers, my companions, Tom Arbor and Bill Seaman,
and a mile and a half or two miles away lay a ship
with her upper sails furled, courses hauled up, and
topsails lowered on the cap, while the surface of the
sea was like glass, though a long, heavy swell was
rolling up from the westward, heralding the approach
of the storm of which the clouds pointed out by Tom
Arbor were the visible harbingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship was the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>, a clipper barque;
and we were three boys belonging to her, and had on
this the third day of continuous and stark calms been
sent away to try our hands at turning a turtle, of
which some had been seen floating on the surface, and
had already been successful in securing two; and
going on in search of others, we had got farther from
the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span> than either we wished or intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See there,” continued Tom; “it’s all hands aboard
the barky. The skipper he sees what’s coming, and
ain’t a-goin’ to be caught napping. Come, we must
give way and get aboard as soon as we may; he’ll be
in no pleasant temper, and the mate or bos’n will
give us a rope’s-ending for supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the fear of the reception which awaited
us, we saw the truth of what Tom said, <a id='bent'></a>and bent to
our oars with all our strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before, however, we had covered half the distance
which lay between us and the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>, the
clouds had risen and obscured the heavens, and we
could feel faint, chill puffs of air fanning our cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give way, lads,” cried Tom, who was pulling
stroke, “or we shall never reach her; and in a cockle-shell
like this we can never live out a storm such as
is coming on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I needed no urging, and if possible pulled
harder than before; but suddenly Tom’s oar broke in
half, and he fell on his back in the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill, astonished at this, let go his oar, and it fell
overboard and drifted astern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Tom regained his seat, we looked
round for the ship, and saw that she was paying off
before the wind with a fore-staysail set, and that, even
if we had our oars, there would be small hope of our
reaching her, while to windward we could see the
rain coming down on us like a wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, lads, we’re in a fix now,” said Tom; “give
me your oar, Sam, and I’ll see if I can scull back to
pick up Bill’s oar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much use in that; the rain will be on us in
five minutes, and we shall be able to see nothing,”
I said; and almost as I spoke, a flash of lightning
seemed to strike the water in our immediate vicinity,
and was instantly followed by a crash of thunder,
which sounded as if heaven and earth were coming
to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with your knives, quick, and cut the sails
loose, and get the lug over the bows fast to the
painter; we may ride to it, while I keep her bows on
with the oar,” (our only remaining one), cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, this was our only chance, for the rain was
upon us and the lightning was flashing all around us;
and in less time than it takes to tell of it, Tom and
I had the sail over the bows, and bent on to the
painter with the tack, and weighted by the leads of
some fishing-lines, which were fortunately in the
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time this was finished, the ship was hidden
from our sight by the storm; and soon the freshness
of the rain turned to salt from the spray driven by
the wind, and the full force and fury of the storm
fell on us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the sea did not get up rapidly, being
kept down by the strength of the wind, and Tom
managed to keep us bows on, and our hastily-extemporized
sea-anchor prevented it from breaking over
us; but Bill and I had all our work cut out to bail
out the water, which we did with a bailer and bucket
that were by good-luck in the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After about two hours, as it must have been,
though to us it seemed much longer, the storm abated,
leaving a nasty, confused sea; but we were able to
keep the boat afloat and fairly dry, though the long,
dark night was most dreary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the day began to dawn, and when the sun
rose the clouds dispersed and the sea got calmer by
degrees. Our first anxiety was to look for the
<span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>, and we eagerly scanned the horizon
for some signs of her; but not a sail was to be seen,
and we three lads were alone in an open boat on the
wide ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going any farther I may as well describe
the three occupants of the boat, and say who we were.
Tom Arbor, as the eldest, should stand first. He was
about seventeen years of age, and was strong built
and active. Like Seaman and myself, he was an orphan
and the son of a sailor drowned at sea. His mother
had brought him up to the best of her ability, and
would have kept him with her, and opposed his
following in his father’s footsteps and going to sea
with her utmost power; but she could no more
prevail with him than a hen who has sat upon ducks’
eggs can stop her brood from taking to the nearest
water by clucking. Accordingly, when but twelve
years of age, he had stowed himself away on board a
ship bound round the Horn to California; and, not
being found till long after the pilot had left, had
made the voyage, and, the skipper being a kindly
man, had been well treated. When he came home
he had found his mother married again to a small
shopkeeper, and she no longer said a word against
his being a sailor; and he had made a voyage to
China and back before shipping on board the <span class='it'>Golden
Fleece</span>, about six months before. He was a cheerful,
good-natured lad, with dark-brown hair and eyes, and
was certainly for his years a good sailor, and could
hand, reef, and steer, splice a rope, and pull an oar as
well as many who were longer at sea and older in years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill Seaman had been picked up on the sea-shore
when about two years old, and was supposed to be
the only survivor from the wreck of a large ship, in
which it was thought his father had been lost; but no
means had come to hand to establish who his father
was, and he had, by the interest of some of the gentry
living near where he was found, been brought up in
an establishment for the orphans of sailors till it
was closed, and he was sent to a workhouse. He
was a clever, bright boy, but small for his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My mother had died when I was born, and when
the ship in which my father was an A.B. came
home, the news was given to an aunt of my mother’s
who had taken charge of me that he had fallen off
the fore-topsail yard off Cape Horn in a winter gale
and been drowned; so my old relative, the only one I
ever knew, had obtained admission for me into the
same asylum as Seaman; and as she died soon after, I
was as destitute of friends or relations as he was.
In this asylum we continued till about the age of
seven, when from one cause or another it was closed,
and Seaman and myself were sent to a workhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here our life was by no means a happy one, and
two or three times we ran away and tried to get
taken as boys on board ships sailing from the sea-port
near which the workhouse was; but no one
would take us, as we were too small and young, and
we were always caught and taken back to the workhouse,
where we were flogged and severely punished
for our attempts to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As may be imagined, our repeated attempts to
escape did not cause our treatment to be any better;
so, after the last time we were brought back, when we
had undergone our punishment, Bill and I consulted
together and agreed—we were only twelve at the
time—that we should wait until we were two years
older, when we hoped to be big and strong enough to
be accepted by some captain, and then to make another
try for freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these two years we did all in our power to
be considered good boys, and with some success, and
applied ourselves to learning the trades which were
taught us, Bill being taught shoemaking, while I was
instructed in carpentering; and at the end of these
two years we had both made some progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our intention of going to sea, however, never left
us, though our good conduct caused us to be treated
more kindly than had hitherto been the case; but I
must say that our instructors punished us for any
mistakes or carelessness most severely, though of this
we did not take much notice, for we saw equal
measure served out to all our companions, and never
for a moment doubted that it was part and parcel
of the necessary teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we were about fourteen we were both called
before the guardians, who spoke to us kindly, and
said that it was their intention to apprentice us to
our respective trades, for which we had shown great
aptitude, and that in about a week or so we should
be bound over to the masters who had been chosen
for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we left the board-room I said to Seaman
that the time had come for us to try to run away to
sea again, for if we were bound apprentice, which, I
know not why, among us and our comrades was
looked upon as a dreadful thing, we should never be
able to get away, and in any case we should be
separated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quite agreed with me, and we made up our
minds to get away the next night. Our dormitory
was on the first floor, and had a long range of
windows, guarded by iron bars, which overlooked a
narrow lane leading down into a part of the town
composed of sailors’ lodging-houses, and along which
scarcely any one passed after dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bars of the windows had only lately been put
in order by the boys in the carpenter’s shop, and
with a screw-driver one could be easily removed, so
that we could get through and cut away the lead of
the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill promised me that he would manage to get a
shoemaker’s knife to cut the lead, while I had to
procure a screw-driver, which I did without being
noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next night, when the occupants of the dormitory
were all sound asleep, we set about our work, and
while Bill got the cord which stretched the sacking
of our beds to lower ourselves into the lane, I unscrewed
the bars and cut the lead framing away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the other boys were disturbed by the
noise; but we were amongst the biggest and strongest,
and by threats and persuasion managed to prevent
them giving the alarm until the last moment, when,
leaving behind us the knife and screw-driver and all
our clothes but our shirts and trousers, for we did
not wish to be considered thieves as well as runaways,
we slid down the rope, and on reaching the bottom
scudded away as fast as we could towards the nearest
seamen’s haunt.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span><h1>CHAPTER II.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN HIDING.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>e soon heard people in pursuit of us, and their
shouts roused the people in the houses near,
and sailors and boarding-house keepers came out
into the streets and alleys to see what the commotion
was all about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ran on blindly, dodging some who would have
stopped us, and not knowing where to look for safety
and shelter, when a great, burly fellow in a crimson
waistcoat and fur cap seized us by the collars and
stayed our progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither bound, you rascals?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please, sir, we’ve left the workhouse, and want
to go to sea,” we panted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” he said, and shoved us before him
into a gloomy court, and then into a door, and after
that through passages, some dark and some dimly
lighted, and up and down broken and slippery stairs,
until at last we came into a small room, which was
lighted by a couple of tallow candles stuck into bottles.
On one side was a bunk like a ship’s, and in the
middle a deal table, on which were a bottle and
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said our guide; “I don’t think the beadles’ll
catch you now. ’Twould puzzle them to find their
way here. Now, let’s have a look at you, and see
whether you’re worth keeping, or ’twould pay best to
get a reward for taking you back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t take us back,” we cried, for though
the appearance of our companion was not calculated
to inspire confidence, we knew that we should be
severely punished if we were taken back to the
workhouse, and that the chance of getting to sea
would be farther off from us than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow that,” he said. “First and foremost, how old
are ye, and what can ye do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir, our names are Bill Seaman and
Sam Hawse, and we can do shoemaking and carpentering,
and we’re fourteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A snab and a chips. Which is which? Now, one
at a time. Seaman, what are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve learned shoemaking, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Hawse, are a carpenter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you seems likely, and I’ll keep you a day
or two. Come along with me,” and opening a door he
went into a long room, at one end of which was a
sort of stage, where a man was roaring out a song
to the accompaniment of an old fiddler, and which was
full of sailors drinking and smoking and eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one corner of this room was a narrow staircase,
up which our conductor took us, and after passing
through rooms full of beds, up other flights of
stairs, and along passages, we came at last to a small
den or cupboard, whose sloping ceiling told us it was
close under the roof. Here the man with the red
waistcoat told us we could sleep, and giving us a
blanket to wrap ourselves in, shut and locked the
door, leaving us in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I were too frightened to say much, so we
rolled ourselves up in the blanket as best we might,
and tried to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day we feared we had been forgotten, for we
heard all sorts of noises below us, but no one came
near us, and we began to think we had done a very
foolish thing in running away, as in the workhouse,
though the food was not always to our taste, still
there was enough, and it came at regular hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried to attract attention by hammering at the
door and shouting, and when that was of no avail
we tried to find some means of getting out; but
we could not find any, for the whole of the place
was carefully boarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we heard voices and footsteps outside, and
the man with the red waistcoat opened the door and
said to some one who accompanied him: “There, you
can lie hid there till she’s sailed; it’s the snuggest stow
in the place. Why,” said he in astonishment, “there’s
them two kids. Blow my eyes, I’d forgotten them.
D’ye think your old man would give anything for
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newcomer, who was a sailor of a somewhat
forbidding aspect, said, “I shouldn’t wonder; boys is
useful. He might give a sov. or two for the pair, and
what with kit and advances, as he calls it, make ’em
work the v’yge for nought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do; when d’ye say the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>
sails?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, she’s hauled out of dock, and sails next tide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But won’t he wait for hands? How many of you
have run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some half-dozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s it; I can give him the men and these
boys too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t give me up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you dunderhead; you’re worth more ashore
than afloat. How many advance notes have you
cashed in a month?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that does me well enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newcomer took our place in the cupboard, but
he was supplied with food and drink and a light,
which had not been granted to us; and the man with
the red waistcoat told us to follow him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “Please, sir, give us something to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, you must be hungry,” he said. “I’d
clean forgotten you. Now come along, and you shall
have a blow-out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed the man down to a sort of kitchen in
a cellar, where three or four women were at work,
and he told them to give us something to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tin dish full of broken victuals was given to us,
and we were told to sit in a corner and eat it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst we were doing so, the women occasionally
came and laughed at us for the way we devoured our
food; but seeing how hungry we were, when the first
dishful was finished they gave us more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last our hunger was appeased; and then we
were made to help as best we could these women,
who told us they were the cooks of the place, which
was one of the largest seamen’s lodging-houses in the
place, and was kept by the man in the red waistcoat,
whose name was Crump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the kitchen we passed the day, but about dusk
we were sent for to Mr. Crump’s sanctum, where we
found him and a decently-dressed, sailor-like man
whom he called Captain Haxell, but whose face
looked like some bird of prey, his eyes were so sharp
and dark and his nose so hooked and pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are the lads now, captain,” said Mr. Crump,
as the kitchen wenches had told us to call him, “and
I think you’ll find them smart and handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand up, and let’s see you,” said the captain.
“So you wish to go to sea? Where are your friends?
Got none, d’ye say? Stow that. Now, your names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We told him our names, and he answered, “Pursers’
names both, you young rascals; but, come now, I
admire spirit in lads, and though there’s some risk,
I’ll take you as ’prentices.—Got any ’prentice forms,
Crump?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, captain,” answered that worthy, and produced
two sheets of paper on which was some writing,
which Captain Haxell told us to sign, and which he
put in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this Crump took us to another room, where
were sailors’ slops of all kinds, and gave us each a
blue shirt and trousers, cap, and jacket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We put them on, and asked for the shirts and
trousers we took off to be sent back to the workhouse,
as it would not be honest to keep them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crump gave a grin, and said our wishes should
be attended, which made us very happy, for the idea
of stealing even the shirts and trousers had been
weighing heavy on our mind; but I am now afraid
that the workhouse authorities never saw those
trousers or shirts again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Haxell, when we returned, said, “Ah!
that’s the style, my young sailors.—Now, Mr. Crump,
how about the men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, captain; I’ve them handy, and a wagon
to take them and their chests down, and the lads too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crump went out, and soon a certain amount of
noise was heard in the passage outside the little den
where we were, as if heavy things were being carried
along, and then when it was quiet again Mr. Crump
came in and said, “All ready, captain. Now, pay me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll pay you on board; come along of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m too old a bird for that; I’m not going to
be paid with the fore-topsail. Pay down here, or not
a soul leaves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Haxell tried persuasion, and said he had
left all his money aboard, and to go to the ship and
come back would cause him to lose a tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t help that,” said Crump. “Pay or leave;
them’s my words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, seeing that Mr. Crump was obdurate,
Captain Haxell took a pocket-book out of his breast-pocket,
and handed over some banknotes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, that’s right—honest seaman and no fraud,”
said Crump. “Now have a glass before you start,”
and, suiting the action to the word, he filled a couple
of tumblers from a bottle that stood on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two worthies drank together, and then Captain
Haxell, telling us to follow him, left the room and
went to a sort of yard, where a covered wagon with
a horse ready harnessed to it was waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tumble in,” said our captain, for so we now must
call him, and accordingly we clambered up into the
hind part, and found it lumbered with sea-chests and
drunken or drugged men; while Captain Haxell,
mounting the box, told the driver to go to the
water-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we found a boat waiting, into which we had
to get, and to assist in placing the men and other
contents of the wagon in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat pulled off to a ship lying some little
distance out with her topsails loosed, and when we
arrived alongside men and chests were hoisted in, and
we scrambled up as well as we could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Haxell, as soon as the boat was clear, called
to the mate to hoist the topsails, brace the yards
abox, and weigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orders and the noise seemed confusing enough
to both Bill and me, and we were shoved and hustled
about, and blamed for being useless, and also for
being in the way; but at last the ship was under way,
and we were standing off the land with all sails set.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span><h1>CHAPTER III.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ADRIFT.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he night was cold and chill, and a drizzling
rain was falling, which speedily wet us through,
as Bill and I stood on the deck, not knowing where
to go or what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drunken men and their chests were all taken
down into the forecastle; but when we attempted to
follow, we were told to stay on deck and do our
work, though what that work was proved a mystery
to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing men coiling up ropes and hanging them on
to belaying pins, we tried to do the same, but only
got cuffs and blows for doing it wrong; so we sheltered
ourselves under the long-boat, thinking that if this
was going to sea, it would have been much better
to have remained in the workhouse to become a
carpenter and a shoemaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we cowered away during the long and dreary
night, and to add to our discomfort, the ship being
close to the wind, bobbing into a choppy head-sea, we
became dreadfully seasick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last daylight came, and we were found and
routed out of our refuge, and brought before the mate
who had the morning watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo! Who are you, and where did you come
from?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stood sillily before him, and answered, “Please,
sir, we’re the two apprentices Captain Haxell brought
off last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apprentices! I never heard of our old man
having apprentices before; but where’s your kit, and
the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kit, sir—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your chests, beds, clothes, you greenhorns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir, we’ve only what we’ve got on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know what to do. I’ll see the
captain when he comes on deck. Here, what are your
names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we told him, the mate said: “Well, Hawse,
you are starboard watch; and, Seaman, you are port
watch. Hawse, your watch below; Seaman, on
deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was Greek to us, but one of the men, in
obedience to the mate, put a swab into Bill’s hand, and
told him to dry the deck, while I was left alone. I
was standing amidships, wondering at what was going
on and what would become of us, when I felt a
hand laid on my shoulder, and a voice, the first with
a tone of kindness in it that I had heard on board,
saying, “What cheer, shipmate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking round, I saw a boy with a good-humoured
smile on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” I said, “what am I to do, and where can
I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you must do what you’re told. Did you
stowaway on board in dock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. I and Bill there,” pointing to him, “are
apprentices, and came on board last night with the
captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apprentices are you? Where are your chests and
hammocks? Got nothing but what you stand up in?
You’re funny ’prentices, and I don’t think the old man
is likely to have ’prentices bound to him, from what I
can see since I’ve been aboard of the hooker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I explained to the speaker, who told me his
name was Tom Arbor, and that he had shipped two
days before the ship sailed, how we had come aboard,
he laughed heartily, and said, “You’re no ’prentices.
The old man maybe wanted boys for something or
other, and he took you. Never mind, I’ll do what I
can for you both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our conversation was interrupted by the captain
coming on deck, and calling for us. “Now, my brave
sailor-boys, how d’ye like the sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Haxell, as he spoke, looked even more like
a bird of prey than he had the day before, and
though his words were cheery, there was something
in the way he said them which chilled us with
fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, however, plucked up courage, and asked where
we were to live, and for some dry clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clothes, you workhouse brats; let them dry on
you. Now you’ve got to work before you eat.
Here,” catching hold of me by the ear, “you go to
the steward, and say he said he wanted a boy, and
I’ve got him one; and you”—to Bill—“go to the
cook for his mate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were told off thus roughly to our duties, and
forewarned that those under whom we had to work
were worse tyrants than any we had had to do with
in the workhouse, but that they were kindness itself
when compared with the captain and mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed from no one on board did we receive any
kindness, except from Tom Arbor, and he himself had
to undergo much ill-treatment. We often longed to
be back at the workhouse again, for there we were
sure of our night’s rest, and of sufficient food, while if
we were treated severely, we had not to suffer from
actual cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving England we were at sea four or five
months, and had during the latter part to suffer from
thirst; for our supply of water was but scanty, and
Bill and I were always the last served, and sometimes
had to go without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding rough treatment and thirst, we
were fortunate enough to keep our health; and when
we first anchored, which was at one of the coral
islands in the Pacific, we were so delighted with all
that we saw of scenery and people—all was so strange,
new, and wonderful—that we thought little of the
pains and hardships we had undergone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, however, we found that even delightful
scenery and climate do not make up all that is necessary
for enjoyment, and that sailing among lovely
islands, especially when one never has a chance of
putting a foot ashore, is but a poor compensation for
blows and ill-treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon found that Captain Haxell traded with
the people of the islands on very peculiar principles.
Indeed, often many of his acts were sheer robbery
and piracy, and though often Tom Arbor consulted
with Bill Seaman and myself as to the possibility of
running away, we were afraid to trust ourselves
among the natives, lest they should avenge upon us
the wrongs they received at the hands of our
shipmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So matters went on, until the day when this story
commences. Certainly we had learned some amount
of seamanship, and were better able to look after
ourselves than when we had left England; but I hope
and trust that it may never again fall to the lot of
English boys to undergo such ill-treatment as we
constantly received. One comfort we had, and one
alone, and that was that Tom Arbor had been
religiously brought up, and taught where to look for
consolation, and showed us how the Christianity we
had heard of in the workhouse was a real and
beautiful thing, instead of, as we had regarded it,
simply one of the subjects of the workhouse school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as we found that there was no ship in
sight, Tom proposed that we should pray for help
and guidance, and if our prayers were offered up in
rough and untutored language, they were as true and
fervent as most that are made in church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When our prayers were finished, we began to
overhaul the boat, to find what we had aboard of her.
Fortunately she had constantly been employed in
trading, and her trade-box, arms, and all other gear
belonging to her were on board, except the oars,
which had unfortunately been taken out, just before
we were sent in chase of the turtle, to be overhauled,
and only the three spoken of above had been passed
into her before the boat was lowered, and of these
three, as will now be remembered, only one remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found we had the mainmast and a dipping lug,
as well as a small triangular mizzen, and we at once
shipped the masts, and made sail to a light breeze
from the westward; and then, with Bill Seaman
steering, Tom Arbor and I opened the trade-box.
On the lid we found a sheet of paper, on which was
written the contents, which mainly consisted of gaudy
beads, brass wire, flints and steels, small hatchets and
knives, and also a book, in which had been entered
what had been expended, and how much had been
replaced, and in which there were many blank sheets.
There was also a bottle of ink and a pen, so Tom said
we could keep a log of our proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we found that the list and trade-book agreed
with the contents of the chest, we looked to see what
were in the lockers, which were fitted under the stern
sheets; and in them we found about four pounds of
pigtail tobacco—which, as none of us had ever taken
to smoking, we determined to keep for trade, knowing
how fond the natives were of it—six and a half
ship biscuits, a piece of boiled salt pork weighing
about a pound, a bottle of rum, two cooked yams, two
pistols, a large packet of ammunition, some gun flints,
a flask of priming powder, a bag with needles and
thread, and some tin plates, pannikins, and spoons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lashed under the thwarts were four muskets
in tarpaulin covers, and there were three small
beakers or casks, one of which was half full of fresh
water, a couple of balls of spun yarn, two fishing-lines
and hooks, and a lead and line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we had completed our search, Tom said,
“Well, my boys, we may be thankful to have so much.
Many a poor fellow has been adrift in a boat without
bite or sup, while what we have here, with these two
turtles, may last us some days; and before it is all
finished, we may fall in with an island or a ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I said we were both hungry and thirsty,
and proposed to make a meal off the pork and biscuits;
but Tom said that they would keep, and that we had
better kill one of the turtles and live on its flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One was accordingly killed and cut up by Tom,
and he gave us each a piece of flesh to eat; but
hungry as we were we could not stomach the idea of
eating it raw, and so we all began to cast about for
some means of cooking our ration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had means of making fire, and the bottom
boards would supply us with fuel, but what were we
to use as a stove or fireplace? This puzzled us for
some time, but at last a bright idea entered into my
head. “Why couldn’t we fill the shell of the turtle
with water, and out of the hoops of the bucket make
a grating on which we could light a fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” said Tom; “but suppose we want
the bucket for bailing again? That won’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But let us look again in the trade-box. Perhaps
there may be something there,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it,” said Bill. “I quite forgot; but I
remember a day or two ago I was told to put some
old cask hoops in the boat, and they are under the
head sheets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking where he said, we found the hoops he
mentioned, and before long we made a sort of fireplace,
which we stood in the turtle shell, and splitting
up one of the bottom boards with our knives
we made a fire, over which we after a fashion
cooked our turtle meat, which we washed down
with a pannikin of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we had finished our meal, Tom said, “Now
we had best try to make some sort of paddles.
There’s the loom of the broken oar and the boathook.
If we fix some of the bottom boards across them, they
will answer until we can arrange something better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner said than done; and I, as carpenter,
managed by dint of hard work before the night fell to
fashion a couple of paddles, which if somewhat clumsy
were at all events better than nothing. Whilst I was
employed about this, Tom and Bill had taken turns in
steering, and in cutting up the turtle, the second of
which was also killed and cut into thin strips, which
they hung on a piece of spun yarn stretched between
the two masts; and when that was finished, they
had cleaned the muskets and seen that they were fit
for use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sunset, Tom, who without any talk or election
had been made our captain, said we had better lower
our sail, as otherwise we might run by or upon land
in the darkness, as many of the coral islands were
but a few feet above the surface of the water, and
only visible from the cocoanut palms growing on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We accordingly lowered the lug, leaving the mizzen
set to keep us head to wind and sea, and arranging
that we should watch in turns. The two who were
watch below rolled themselves up in the sail, Bill
remarking that it was better than the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>,
where at the best it was watch and watch, and
often watch and watch on, whereas now we were in
three watches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning watch fell to my lot, and just before
the sun rose I saw away on the eastern horizon a line
of spots which looked like the sails of ships, but
which by this time I had learned were cocoanut
palms on a coral island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I instantly called my companions, and it being a
dead calm, after we had made a breakfast, at which,
as land was in sight, Tom allowed us half a biscuit
apiece, we got out our paddles and commenced to
pull in the direction in which I had seen the tops
of the trees.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ON A CORAL ISLAND.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“F</span>ortunately for us it is calm,” said Tom,
when, after two or three hours’ paddling, Seaman
and myself began to complain that the land
seemed to remain as far away as ever. “Never
mind; pull on my boys,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so, Tom?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see how as we’ve been having the south-east
trades regular till about a week ago; and they
may set in again at any time, and then instead of
creeping toward land, we should be blown away to
leeward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly Tom Arbor was right, and that we
might soon expect the trades to be blowing from
their accustomed quarter was evident by the long
swell which was rolling up from the south-east; and
the idea of being blown away from the land, which
was already in sight, was quite enough to make us toil
away at our paddles without flagging or complaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sun was high over our heads at mid-day,
we were obliged to stop for a short spell, and begged
for water; and though Tom at first refused, as he said
we were not yet on shore, after much begging he
relented and gave us a half-pint pannikin full each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Refreshed by this, we took to our paddling with
renewed vigour, though we were somewhat dismayed
to find that during our short rest we had drifted
back a part of our hard-won distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, my boys,” said ever-cheery Tom;
“pull away, and as we get closer we shall be protected
by the island from the current.” And, as the event
proved, his words were true, for after paddling for
another hour and a half we came to a bit of broken
water where the current, which was divided by the
coral island, met again, after passing through which
we found we made good progress, and at about half-past
four we found ourselves close to the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the side we approached there was no surf, and
we were able to beach the boat in safety, and carrying
the anchor up we buried it in the ground, and
securing the cable to it we were able to leave the
boat safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were glad indeed to find ourselves ashore, and
went up to the cocoanut palms which we had seen
to look for some fallen nuts, but our attention was
soon drawn to the peculiarities of the place. The
island was in the form of a circle, enclosing a lagoon
about a mile and a half in diameter, while the width
of the encircling reef, for it was little more, was not
over a hundred and fifty yards. On the outside the
edges went sheer down, but inside they sloped away
gradually, and on the weather or south-eastern side a
heavy surf was breaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon found some cocoanuts, and hacking off
the outside covering with a hatchet, we cut through
the shell, and enjoyed a refreshing draught of the
sweet, cool milk, and then splitting them open we ate
the kernels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I now proposed to take our belongings
out of the boat, and make a tent out of the sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so quick,” answered Tom. “I know all these
reefs have an opening somewhere on the lee-side,
through which the lagoon can be entered. Now I will
take a musket and go one way, and you two take
another and go the other way, and whichever finds
an entrance will fire; and then we shall all come back
to the boat, and bring her in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was soon settled, and seeing that the boat was
properly secured, we started off, Bill and I going
towards the south, and Tom towards the north.
Every step seemed to give new life to Bill and me;
for we both agreed that to be on an uninhabited
island was one of the most delightful things that
could possibly happen, and that it was indeed a
happy change after the cruel treatment to which
we had been subjected on board the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>.
Along the sand ran multitudes of crabs, which, as we
approached, dodged into their burrows, emerging again
as soon as we had passed. Seaweeds of strange form
and colour were scattered about, and among the cocoanut
palms were grasses and plants the like of which
we had never seen before, while besides seabirds of
many kinds we were delighted to see pigeons flying
about, larger than those we are accustomed to in
England, and of brighter plumage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Sam Hawse,” said Bill to me after we had
been walking about a quarter of an hour, “this is a
jolly place. See, there’s a pigeon on that trunk. Give
me the gun, and let’s have a shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Bill,” I answered; “wait, for that would
bring Tom running back to us, and I know he would
be angry. Let’s find the entrance if we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely were the words out of my mouth when
we heard Tom Arbor’s musket, and turning back we
hurried towards the boat, which we reached just after
he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bear a hand, my hearties,” he cried, as soon as he
saw us. “Look there to the westward; there’s another
of the same squalls as the one we lost the <span class='it'>Golden
Fleece</span> in coming up; that’s why the trades aren’t
blowing. We must get the boat inside before it
comes, or she’ll be knocked to pieces here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No words on his part were necessary to make us
hurry, for the whole western horizon was banked up
with heavy clouds; and lifting the anchor we put it
in the boat, and then launched her off the narrow
beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gave way with a will along the shore, and soon
came to the entrance which Tom had found, which
was some thirty feet wide and ten deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are others farther on,” said Tom, “so we
must pull back some little way to get good shelter;”
and finding, after pulling along on the inside for five
minutes or so that the reef seemed higher there than
elsewhere, we determined on landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly we put the boat ashore, and hauling
her up as high as we could, we ran out the cable and
made it fast round the stem of a cocoanut tree, and
then began to make our preparations for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” said Tom, “as there’s no time to build
a hut, we can use the sail for a tent; so, Bill, you
bring it ashore, while Sam and I lash the mast to
those two palms for a ridge pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rising of the clouds warned us that we had no
time to lose, so as quickly as we could we rigged up
our tent and tied the sail down to small palm trees to
prevent its being blown away; and then we brought
our muskets, ammunition, and all other belongings,
including the trade-box, up, and arranged them under
its shelter, and Bill and I were soon quite delighted
at the appearance of our little tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, we had not much time for looking about,
for the rain came down heavily on us, and was soon
followed by a squall of wind, which levelled our tent
with the ground, burying us under the folds of the
wet canvas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We scrambled out as quickly as we could, but such
was the fury of the blast that we could scarcely keep
our feet, and we could hear the crash of falling palms
all around us, while the feathery heads of those that
stood could be seen waving wildly by the lurid light
of the flashes of lightning, which were accompanied
by peals of deafening thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did all we knew to prevent the sail being
blown away, as once or twice seemed more than
probable; for the wind, getting under a corner, lifted
it up and almost tore it from our grasp. Indeed, we
were dragged along by it for some little distance,
when it came against a palm that stayed it, and soon
the palm with the canvas wrapped around it fell,
and effectually secured it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ere long a new terror was added to our situation,
for by the glimpses given us of our island refuge by
the lightning, we saw that the reef both to the right
and left of us was entirely under water, and that the
spot we had chosen for our camp seemed as if it
might be submerged at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boat!” cried I; “let’s get into her sooner
than stay here to be drowned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that hope of refuge was cut off from us, for
as we started towards her we saw her driven from
her moorings and blown away towards the other side
of the lagoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know I lost heart, and began to wring my hands
and to cry out that we should die, and Bill Seaman
told me since that he was quite as frightened as I
was. Tom Arbor, however, kept his presence of mind,
and said, “Don’t be frightened, lads; the Lord, who
preserved us in the boat and brought us here, will
not desert us ashore. Let us pray to Him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suiting his action to his words, Tom knelt down,
and amid the driving rain and spray offered up a
prayer, and Bill and I followed his example. The
words may not have been according to formula, but I
am sure they were meant reverently; and as if in
answer to our prayer, the wind fell, and the rain
ceased, and the stars shone brightly, while the water
subsided from the surface of the reef.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We instantly set to work to look after our belongings,
and found that the mast had been snapped in
two and the sail torn, but that no real harm had
happened to anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We felt very cold and shivery, and Bill’s teeth
rattled like a pair of castanets, and he said, “I wish
we could make a fire; but there’s nothing to burn.
Everything is soaking wet with the rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rain can’t soak all the way through the husk of
a cocoanut,” said Tom, “and there are plenty of old
ones about. Now set to work to look for them, while
I find a hatchet to split them up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon found not only a lot of nuts which were
withered, and on being split open gave us lots of dry
fibre, but also we found that many of the fronds
which lay about had been so protected from the rain
and spray by others that lay upon them that they
were fit for fuel; and from the net-like shield or
spathe of the base of the fruit-stalk we easily made
kindling; and not more than half an hour after the
end of the storm we had a fire blazing brightly, and
were broiling turtle steaks over it and drying our
clothes, laughing and talking as if we had not just
escaped from death by the fact of our having chosen
a bit of reef a few feet higher than the rest for our
camping-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time I said, “I wonder if this island has
a name. I think we may as well give it one. What
do you say to Ring Island? It is just in the form of
one, and where we came in is like where the stone
is set.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other two laughed at me, and Tom said, “We
want something more practical than a name; though,
if you like, we will call it Ring Island. We have
to think how we are to live, and how we are to get
away; for I for one do not wish to stop for ever here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” chimed in Bill and myself; “but
what are your ideas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had no time to think yet; but I have one, and
that is that we had better go to sleep now, and then
to-morrow we must explore the island, and see if we
can find our boat or what remains of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill said he did not feel sleepy; but Tom argued
that if we did not sleep now, we should want to
sleep in the daytime, when we should be working, and
that sleep we must in order to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all laughed at this, and piling fuel on the fire
we made ourselves a nest of dry leaves near it, and
were soon all sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was awaked the next morning by Tom shaking
me by the shoulder, and opening my eyes found it
was broad daylight. Bill Seaman was sitting up
yawning, and saying he did not think he had been to
sleep at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Tom; “I’ve been up half an hour
and got some breakfast ready. See here,” and he
pointed to a tin plate full of turtle steaks, which he
had cooked. “Now make haste, both of you, and eat
your breakfasts, and then we’ll start off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We needed no bidding to make us fall to; but
when we came to drinking, I said, “It’s all very well
drinking cocoanut milk; but I think we may get tired
of that, and the island does not seem big enough for a
river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking about,” said Tom, “before I
woke you, and close by I found some pools of rain-water;
so we can fill our beakers and the trade-chest,
for that’s water-tight; and lest the water should dry
up or leak away, we had better do so at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was soon done, and then, having covered up all
our belongings with leaves, we each took a musket
and some cartridges, a cocoanut shell full of water
to drink, and some turtle to eat, and set out on our
journey of discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we left our camp we found that the cocoanut
palms had been levelled all along the reef, except
where we had been, and on the side of the lagoon
opposite; and we soon found that to get round the
island by toiling through and across the prostrate
trunks, which lay strewn in inextricable confusion,
would be more than we could do in one or even
two days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How were we to manage to get round to the other
side, was now a question to be solved; and after some
consultation we determined to return to our camp
and set to work to build some sort of raft or
catamaran, in which we might navigate the lagoon
enclosed by the reef, a proposition on Bill’s part that
we should wade and swim along the shore being
decidedly negatived by the appearance of a huge,
hungry-looking shark, that looked as if it would
have been only too glad to make a meal off us.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span><h1>CHAPTER V.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FISH-CURING.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>n leaving the camp we had kept along the
centre of the reef, and, before deciding to
return, we had examined both sides to see if by any
means we might manage to continue our road along
the narrow beach; and in doing so we came upon
pools of salt water which were literally alive with fish,
and as we could see that the water was draining away
through the sands, there could be little doubt that
they would soon be left high and dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Tom Arbor saw them, he clapped his
hands and said that here was a chance of laying in a
good stock of provisions, and that it would be better
to secure them before they went bad, and even before
we thought of our catamaran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were puzzled as to how he meant us to proceed;
but he said he had been shipmates with a Yarmouth
lad on a previous voyage, and he had told him how
herrings were prepared by salt and smoking, and that,
even if we had no salt, we could smoke a good many,
and so provide ourselves with a stock which would
last us some time, and which would be a pleasant
variety to the cocoanuts, which, so far as he saw, were
the only vegetable products fit for food to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We at once set to work at one pool and picked
out a lot of fish, which we strung on our ramrods and
carried back to camp with us. And after Tom had
shown me and Bill how to clean and split them open,
he set to work to prepare a number of thin, light
rods out of the midribs of the leaves of the palms
which had been blown down. On these he slipped
the fish as soon as we had completed cleaning them,
putting his rods in at one of the gills and out at the
mouth of each of the fish; and when a rod was strung
with fish about four inches apart, he put it on a couple
of uprights planted in the ground, under which he
lighted a fire, which he banked down with green
leaves and damped cocoanut husks, so as to cause a
dense smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” he said—“that will do after a fashion; but
at Yarmouth, I’m told, they have houses to keep the
smoke in. And now you, Bill, had better make a
basket out of some of these leaves, and go and get
some more fish, while Sam and I set to work to rig
up some sort of a hut for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “Why should we have our hut here?
Isn’t the other side of the reef bigger? It looks so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said; “but don’t you see the palms over
there waving in the breeze? It’ll soon be down on
us. And that must be the trades setting in again;
and they’ll blow for months and months without
taking off. It’s only when there are storms for a
time that they cease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why’s that, Tom?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t rightly tell the reason, but so it is; and
while they’re a-blowing there’ll always be a big surf
tumbling on that side. And if ever it happen that we
see a ship, and have to get off to her, it’ll be from this
side that we shall have to make a start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom now chose four palm trees which had not been
blown down, and telling me to get a couple of axes
from among our stores, he and I set to work to cut
them off as high up as we could manage by standing
on the top of our beakers and the trade-chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four trees stood at the corners of a space about
twelve feet long by eight wide, and would, he said,
make the main posts of the hut we were to build; and
before Bill came back with his load of fish two of
them had been cut at a height of six feet from the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bill came back, he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you say the Yarmouth folk used salt for
their herrings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Tom. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, because I’ve found some. There’s a bit of
rock stands up above the ground about a hundred
yards away, and the top of it is fashioned like a
basin, and in that there’s a lot of salt, though it’s
wet now from last night’s rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good news, anyway. Do you just go and
get some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right!” answered Bill; and he soon returned
with a couple of handkerchiefs filled with coarse, wet
salt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, how do they put the salt into the fish and
smoke ’em at the same time?” I asked. “We haven’t
a harness-tub to put ’em in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t rightly know,” said Tom; “but I suppose
if, when we’ve cleaned a fish out, we put some salt
inside, and tie it up again with a strip of palm leaf
before hanging it up to smoke, it’ll answer pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all now set to work cleaning the fish Bill had
brought, and filled their insides with salt, and then
hung them up as we had done the others; and when
we had finished we found we had about forty unsalted
and sixty salted, averaging over a pound weight each,
most of them being a sort of rock cod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this Tom said we might be satisfied for the
time, and that we should now get on with our hut as
fast as we could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two remaining trees were soon cut, and just
as I was going to jump down off the trade-chest, on
which I had been standing (the trade winds had now
reached our side of the reef), I saw something black
floating in the middle of the lagoon, and looking
steadily at it, I soon saw that it was our boat, but
that from the way she was floating she must be half full
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” I cried, “hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, mate?” said both of my companions
in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s our boat a-coming back to us of her
own accord,” I answered, pointing her out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a providence,” said Tom. “We must keep
an eye on her, that she don’t get drifted out through
one of the entrances. Now, then, one must keep a
watch on her; and as ’twas you, Sam, as first saw her,
you do so. But you can keep your hands employed
in making sinnet for lashings for the house out of the
palm leaves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was soon busy making sinnet, and keeping an eye
on the boat, while from the sound of the axes I could
hear that Tom and Bill were busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat drifted pretty rapidly across the lagoon,
and seemed to be coming straight towards us until
she came to within about two hundred yards of the
shore, when she altered her direction and began to
move quickly towards the entrance by which we had
got into the lagoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been desirous of securing her without saying
a word to my companions, but now I feared that I
should be unable to do so, and called to them to come
to my assistance. Seaman at once proposed to swim
off to her, but Tom Arbor would not allow him, for
fear of sharks, and said we had best go to the opening
by which we had entered the lagoon, for she
would be sure to drift there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not mistaken, for she grounded just at the
inner end, and we were able to secure her without
any risk, and tow her back to where our camp was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, lads,” said Tom, “we had better bail her
out and haul her up on shore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set to work to bail her out, but soon found
that she leaked so much that it was hopeless to
attempt it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s no use as she is,” I said. “We must get
her up ashore and see what we can do to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very well, but how can we haul her up
full of water?” answered both Bill and Tom in a
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, where water comes in, it must be able to go
out; and every bit we raise her out of the water, she
will empty herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True; but we’re not strong enough to haul her up
the weight she is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it!” I cried, after thinking a minute or
two. “Let’s put a palm trunk against two of the
uprights of the house, and bringing the cable to it,
rig a Spanish windlass. And some of those small
palms I see you’ve been cutting for ridge-poles and
rafters will do for handspikes and rollers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My proposal was hailed with delight, and from the
small palms, which were not more than three or four
inches in diameter, we soon cut some levers and
rollers, and essayed to heave the boat up. We found,
however, that our utmost efforts would not move the
boat when she was once solidly aground, and that,
heave as we might, we only buried her bows in the
sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After wasting our strength for about a quarter of
an hour, we stopped to regain our breath, and walking
down to the boat, Tom said he would pass the
cable round her outside, so as not to bury her; and
this being done we gave another heave, but with no
better results than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” I said, “these handspikes are too
short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” answered Tom, “but how are we to
reach the tops of longer ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not bend the leadline or boat’s sheet on?”
said Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better still,” I answered. “We have the blocks
of the sheet and halyards. We can reeve a jigger,
and make it fast to the top of our lever, and the
other end we’ll bring down to that palm there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This at last answered, and with each shift of our
tackle we were able to haul the boat up about six
inches, and in little more than an hour we had got her
half out of the water, and altogether on rollers, and
found that the water that remained in her no longer
ran out. So we set to work and bailed her out, and
then she was so much lighter that we were able to
dispense with our purchase and long levers and use
our short ones again, and before another hour was
past we had her high and dry on the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now left her and set to work about our hut
again, and lashing small palm trunks to the four
corner-posts, we had the frame of our shanty pretty
well up before the sinking of the sun warned us that
it was time to prepare for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spread the torn sail over the weather side to protect
us from the wind, and Bill went to the nearest
pool to get some fresh fish for our supper, for we
would not touch those we had put to smoke; and
they were soon grilling on the embers, and furnished
us with a capital meal, which we washed down with
cocoanut milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper finished, we made our beds of leaves, and
laid us down to sleep, thoroughly tired with our day’s
work; but first of all Tom proposed that we should
have prayers, and return thanks to God for the
mercies shown to us; and this good custom once
established, we never departed from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we woke in the morning, Tom and Bill said
they would thatch our hut, and that I, as the carpenter
of the party, should examine the boat and see what I
could do to repair her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first sight my task seemed nearly hopeless, for
many of her planks were split, and her seams were
open and gaping over all the fore part of her, and I
had neither nails nor planks with which to mend her.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>om and Bill went on with the hut, and rapidly
thatched the roof and weather side, while I
was trying, with the fibre of the husks of cocoanuts,
to calk the seams and splits in the boat; but I found
that instead of doing good I only did harm, for as I
forced my extemporized oakum into the openings
they gaped wider and wider, and I had to come to
the conclusion that to repair a clincher-built boat by
calking was beyond my power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came up to where my companions were at work,
and told them of my failure, and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I can do nothing to the boat. I only
make the leaks worse by calking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be down-hearted, mate. We’ll have a look
at her, and see if we can’t figure out a way to make
her sea-worthy, for I don’t intend to live on this
island all my days,” said Tom. “Now it’s about time
to knock off work for an hour or so, and after we’ve
had some food, we’ll all set to work to thatch the hut
and have it finished before night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly we knocked off work, and while Bill
went to get some fresh fish from a pool, Tom and I
went to make up the fire by which we were smoking
those we had prepared the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In doing this we found that some coral and shells,
which had been mixed up with the fuel, had been
burnt, and when we touched it, it fell to pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s lime,” said Tom. “Now that gives me
an idea. In India and China I’ve seen lime and oil
used for calking instead of pitch, and we’ll plaster
the boat inside with the mixture, so as to keep out
the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very well,” I said, “but where’s the oil to
come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, out of the cocoanuts. You know all the
copra, as they call it, which we shipped in the <span class='it'>Golden
Fleece</span> is only dried cocoanut kernels, and all they use
it for is to make oil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, but we can’t get the oakum to hold in
the boat, and all your oily mortar will crack out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt we’ll find a way. But come now, Bill
has dinner ready, and after dinner we’ll finish the
hut, and I daresay before long we’ll think of a way
to patch the boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening saw our hut, as far as the outside
was concerned, pretty well finished, and we were able
to sleep in it comfortably and warmly. Next morning,
when Bill went to fetch our fish for breakfast, he
brought back the unpleasant news that several of the
pools were dry, and the fish dead and beginning to
smell most unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tom, “we must clear them out, or
we shall be killed by the smell. We shall have a
regular pestilence. After breakfast we must set
about that before anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set out accordingly as soon as we could, and
found that what Bill had said was only too true, and
a most unpleasant day’s work we had throwing the
dead fish into the sea; and we found that even in the
pools where some water remained it was sinking so
rapidly that the fish in them would soon die also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we sat round our fire that night, we were speaking
of the necessity of going on with this disagreeable
work, when Bill said, “Anyway, we might make a
pond here of coral rocks, which would keep a good
many in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, Bill,” I answered. “Don’t you
think so, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely; and we can’t do better than go on with
it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, as soon as it was light, we set about
looking for a spot where we could keep our fish, and
before long we lighted on a small creek about twenty
feet long by ten wide at the entrance, and in which
the water was about six feet deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To close up the entrance with a pile of coral
blocks thrown together loosely was not a difficult
matter, and during the whole of the next week we
were busy doing this and filling the pond or stew
with live fish, salting and smoking others, and finishing
our house, to which we contrived a door and
windows, closed with frames made of the midribs
of the palm leaves, on which were worked a matting
of the fronds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our beds we made of the husks of dry cocoanuts,
which we pounded with stones to loosen the fibre;
and from the shells of the nuts we fashioned a
number of utensils which we added to our scanty
stock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this work was all finished, I asked Tom Arbor
if he had thought of any means of repairing our boat,
and he said “Yes,” and that now we could set about
it as soon as we liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His plan, when he described it, was to make a coating
all over the inside of the boat below the thwarts
of cocoanut fibre mixed with lime and oil, and to keep
it in its place by an inner lining of planks fashioned
out of the trunks of the palms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea seemed capital, and we had now to provide
means for carrying it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole time we had been drying our
fish, of which we now had some two hundred pounds
well cured and salted, and which, we found, made a
pleasant change from those we took out of our stew,
we had mixed coral and shells with the fuel, and had
now a good stock of lime. The oakum from the
husks of the cocoanuts we could easily make—indeed,
by this time we had become so expert in preparing
it that ambitious ideas of rope-making had entered
our heads; but to secure the inner lining, and to
provide the necessary oil for our cement, was a more
difficult business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried boiling bits of the copra, or dried kernel,
in our pannikins, and soaking pieces in the shells of
the turtles, which we had carefully preserved, but
with but little success. Next we made a rude
mortar by chopping a square hole in the side of a
prostrate palm and pounding the copra in it; but the
fibrous wood soaked up the oil as quickly as we
pounded it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now, let’s put our considering-caps on
again, and see what we can do,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last I said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it! Let’s make a square box, and plaster
it inside with lime, and then fill it with the copra
chopped as fine as we can in bags of palm leaves, and
then squeeze it with a lever and purchase in the
same way as we got the boat up, and let the oil run
into the turtle shell and any empty cocoanuts we can
muster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After several attempts, which were more or less
unsuccessful, we managed to rig up a sort of press;
and at the end of a fortnight we had enough oil for
our purpose, and then set to work to split our planks
for the lining. This was easy enough, as the trunks
of the trees were easily divided; but when we had
all our material ready, the question of securing the
lining had to be faced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the bottom boards and stern and head sheets,
which we had to take up to do our work thoroughly,
we managed to get a good many nails, and out of the
wood we made strips to run athwart ships over our
planks of cocoanut; and these strips we shaved and
nailed down in their places, and so at last managed to
get the boat water-tight, and, as Tom said, much
stronger, in case she ran on a rock, than she had
ever been before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he said, “we will go for a voyage to the
other side of the island; but first we will paint her
over outside with lime and oil, so that the weeds
won’t grow on her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This did not take us long, and when we had
finished we launched her, and found to our delight
that she was perfectly stanch; but when she was in
the water, we found that we had put so much extra
weight in her that she floated dangerously low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Tom, “that won’t do; if she shipped a
sea now she would go down like a stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, anyway, we can go to the other side of the
lagoon, for there must be some pigeons there. We
saw some the first day, and none have come near
our hut, and I’m tired of fish and cocoanuts,” said
Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t run any risk,” said Tom. “I’ll deck
her right in, except a well for our stores, and we can
raise on her gunwale with a couple of good strakes
of palm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More work!” I answered. “And where are the
nails to come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No nails wanted. We’ll lace ’em on India
fashion,” said Tom, “and put a couple of half
trunks round her as fenders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s work enough, Tom. However, as you say
it, done it must be; but I hope you’ll remember the
carpenter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom laughed, and said it was but to be on the safe
side, and that he intended to have the boat sea-worthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We got the boat moored in a little creek like that
we had made into our fish pond, and for the next
three days we were very busy with her, and got
a strake of cocoanut plank about eight inches wide
round her fore and aft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was done, Bill and I at last prevailed
on Tom to make the voyage to the weather side of
the lagoon to see what might be found there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I flew for our paddles as soon as Tom
assented to our wish, and taking with us some smoked
fish and a dozen of green cocoanuts to drink on our
way, we started off, Bill and I paddling, while Tom
was busy in the stern hammering and chopping at
something which, as to paddle we faced forward, we
could not see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you making all that row about, Tom,
old man?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind. You’ll see in good time,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” I cried; “Tom has an old head on young
shoulders. I wonder his hair ain’t grey. He’s doing
something good, you may be sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we left off paddling once or twice to open
a cocoanut and drink its juice, Tom hid what he
had been doing from us, and it was not until we
landed on the weather part of the reef that we found
what he had been doing, when he proudly loaded a
musket he had brought with him with slugs, and
firing, knocked over a couple of green pigeons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill was so delighted with this that he begged to
be allowed to pluck and cook them at once, saying he
cared more for a roast pigeon than for all the discoveries
we were going to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving him intent on his culinary labours, Tom
and I pushed on through the cocoanut trees, and after
walking some fifty yards we came to a small mound
or protuberance of a different sort of rock from the
coral of which the rest of the island was composed,
and from this gushed forth, more precious in our eyes
than a gold mine or all the diamonds of Golconda, a
tiny rill of crystal-bright water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We both saw it at the same moment, and, rushing
forward, drank, and bathed our hands and faces, and
set up a great shout to call Bill to come to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So absorbed were we in the delight of finding this
spring—for we had not the slightest hope of finding
one on this reef—that it was not till after Bill,
attracted by our shouts, had come up to us that we
noticed the signs of man’s handiwork close to the
spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the ground we saw lying some troughs made
of hollowed palm trunks, which had evidently once
conveyed the waters of the spring to some place
where they were required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us follow up these,” I said. “We may find
something of use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much likelihood,” said Tom. “Some poor
shipwrecked man made these, and they have evidently
not been used for years. He has either died
or else got away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, we can but look to see how he lived,
and we may find something that will be of use,” I
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” replied Tom; “we’ve come over to see
the whole place, and we will look carefully about for
anything that may be of use, only don’t raise your
hopes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had he spoken when we heard the crowing
of a cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” cried Bill; “there’s fowls. There may
be some one alive yet. Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all pushed forward in the direction of the
sound, and soon came upon a space which had once
been cleared, but was now all covered with undergrowth,
and in the midst of which stood a hut, the
walls of which, being built of logs cut from the palms,
still remained, but the thatched roof had fallen in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards this we pushed our way, disturbing, as we
did, several fowls, and noticing that among the tangled
undergrowth there grew a good quantity of maize,
and that evidently at one time this space had been
cultivated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up the walls of the hut grew creepers, and the
holes which had served as door and windows were
thickly matted with them, so that we had to cut
them away in order to effect an entrance.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BILL MAKES A DISCOVERY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen we got inside we could at first see but
little, for the thatched roof, which had
fallen in, had buried everything with a dusty brown
covering; so we set to work to clear this out, and see
if it hid anything that might be of value to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one corner there was apparently a mound of
these half-decayed leaves, and we decided on commencing
our work there; but judge of our horror
when, after removing a few armfuls, we came upon
the skull of a man, and then proceeding more carefully
and reverently, we uncovered a skeleton lying
on a sort of bed-place, wrapped in blankets, which
crumbled to dust as we touched them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow,” said Tom; “he must have died here
alone, with none to bury him. Let us do it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Bill and I agreed with this, for we were too
frightened by these poor remains of mortality to
go on with our search, and we gladly set to work
to clear away a space where with our knives and
hatchets we could dig a grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While we were thus occupied, Tom made a sort of
mat of plaited palm leaves, in which he carefully put
the skeleton, and lashed it all up with sinnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder who or what he was,” he said, as he
came bearing his sad burden to where Bill and I were
at work, and had by this time dug the grave to a depth
of about three feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do,” said Tom; “now get some palm
leaves, and line the whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as we had done this, we reverently laid
the bundle containing the skeleton in the grave, and
covered it in, and then at Tom’s suggestion we knelt
down and said the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time it was getting on toward sunset, and
it was necessary to prepare for our night’s lodging.
While Tom went to see the boat properly secured, I
made a fire, and Bill acted as cook; and as in looking
about for fuel I had come upon a nest of eggs, we
promised ourselves a feast, and glad indeed were
we to wash down the eggs with sweet, fresh water,
and to add to our meal some heads of Indian corn
roasted in the ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning before daylight Tom woke Bill and
me, and said, “Now be quiet and come with me. I
have marked where the fowls roost, and if we come
on them softly, we may secure some before they
wake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly and stealthily we stole to the place Tom
showed us, and there we found the remains of a shed,
under which there were a series of perches on which
some thirty or forty fowls were roosting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As quietly as we could we seized on them, and tied
their legs together; but before we had secured more
than a dozen, the rest were alarmed and made their
escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, lads,” said Tom; “we’ll get the others
another night. And now, when we have had breakfast,
we will go on with the examination of the hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take us long to clear out the remainder
of the thatch, and we soon found that the hut had
been built with great care and ingenuity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bed-place on which we had found the skeleton
occupied one corner, and under it was a seaman’s
chest, in which we found some carefully-patched
clothes, and the tattered remains of a Bible, and the
fragments of a chart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No name or anything to give a clue to their owner
was to be found, except that on the horn handle of a
clasp-knife were cut “Jack” and a couple of crosses.
We also found a sailor’s ditty-bag, containing needles
and thread, palm for sewing, beeswax, and buttons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom said he was glad indeed to find the Bible, for
now he said we should be able to read a chapter
every night when we said our prayers; and the chart
he carefully examined to see if it might give a clue
to our whereabouts, and tell us if any inhabited
islands existed within a distance which we might
reach in safety in our boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the chart there was a cross made with a bit
of charcoal, and from it were drawn a series of lines
in various directions, as if the unhappy man whose
remains we had buried had pored over it for many
a weary hour, and attempted to calculate some means
of escape from his solitary island home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curious!” I said. “He must have tried to make a
boat or something. But see, there are a lot of islands
away to the westward of that cross, which I suppose
means this island; I should think he might have
tried for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit, mates,” said Tom; “we’ll find out
more soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And proceeding with our search in the middle of
the room, we found a table, which had fallen to
the ground, made of some pieces of wood which had
evidently belonged to the companion of a ship, and
stools of the same material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the table we found written in charcoal letters,
which could scarcely be deciphered:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“......cowar-s......left alone......no hope......ill
......heart-broken......money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What this meant we soon understood, all except the
last. The man we had buried had been deserted by
his companions; but what was meant by money we
could not understand. Perhaps they had had money
on the island, and quarrelled about its division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This we put carefully on one side, and then, proceeding
with our search, we found a fireplace made
of wood, plastered with lime, and full of wood-ashes,
and on it were an iron pot and a frying-pan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scattered about we found cups made out of cocoanut
shells, and a couple of plates, which had been
broken and cleverly cemented with lime on to bits
of wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evidently he did not die of starvation,” said Tom,
“for he had fowls, cocoanuts, and Indian corn; but
now let us see what else there is on the island, for
I think we have pretty well seen everything in the
hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the hut, we passed through the clearing,
and then through some more palm trees, and soon
emerged on the weather side of the island, on which
the surf was beating with relentless fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, half buried in sand or hidden by vegetation,
we found scattered about the wreckage of a schooner
of about two hundred tons, which must have been run
plump on to the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close to the beach we found another small hut,
inside which were stowed canvas, carpenter’s tools,
and cordage; and close by we could see several pieces
of wood from the wreck, which had evidently been
fashioned into parts of a boat, and a pile of planks
from the deck of the ship, as well as several others of
her belongings, all covered over with the remnants of
palm-thatching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever he was, the man had been trying to
build a boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what prevented him,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that sticking up there?” I asked, pointing
to a piece of wood among the undergrowth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the handle of an adze,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking at this, we soon found the reason why
the unfortunate man had desisted from his work, and
probably the cause of his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rusty iron of the adze had stuck deep in a
plank, and lying by it were some small bones, which
it did not need any knowledge of anatomy to see
belonged to a human foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently the unfortunate creature had chopped off
a part of his foot while engaged in fashioning a piece
of wood, and had managed to get back to his hut to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow,” said Bill and I in a breath; “he
never could have built a craft here, and launched
her through that surf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered thoughtful Tom Arbor, “but he
may have intended to build her on the other side,
and only shaped the parts here, so as to have less
weight to carry or drag across; but, anyway, his death
is our good fortune, for we can deck and rig our boat
for sea-going from what is here. If I mistake not
we need it, for there’s never an island on that chart
within three hundred miles of us; and if there are
any nearer, they’re likely but places like this, with
ne’er a living soul aboard of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you intend to do?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, rig up this hut again, and then get all our
belongings over to this side; and then deck our boat,
and rig her with something easier to handle than a
dipping lug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; but now we must look after the fowls
we caught; they’ll be hungry and thirsty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon made our way back to the hut; and as
many of its rafters were still sound, it did not take
us very long to put a roof on that would keep out
the sun and all ordinary rain. Bill was off to
make a coop for the fowls that we had caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This done, we set steadily to work, and after getting
all the things that we had left at our first camp
to this place, where we were blessed with water, we
again hove our boat up on shore; and now, having
wood and materials, Tom and I laboured to make a
real trustworthy craft, while Bill was told off to look
after the fowls, and remove the undergrowth from
the clearing, being careful not to injure the maize,
which we trusted would furnish us with a supply of
food for our intended voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, Tom and I made a deep false keel to
our craft, which we named the <span class='it'>Escape</span>; and as we
could not through bolt it to the keel, we put planks
on either side of keel and false keel, and overlapping
both, and nailed all solidly together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being done, we fixed a head knee in a similar
manner; and then having given the <span class='it'>Escape</span> a thorough
good coating of lime and oil, we launched her again,
lest she should get too heavy for us to manage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This naturally had taken us some days, and Tom
and I had laboured from morning to night at her,
only coming to the hut for meals, which Bill had
always ready for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill, the evening that we had got the <span class='it'>Escape</span> afloat,
said, “You two fellows must think me a precious lazy
hound not to come and help you more than I have.
Now the boat’s afloat, I want you to come with me
to-morrow to see what I have been doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, catching fowls, clearing out the water-troughs,
making up the pool they lead into afresh,
and all manner of things,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not all. I have had time to hunt about,
and if you’ll come with me to-morrow, I’ll show you
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we, Tom?” I asked. “I want to think
about our ship before we go on with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps one day won’t matter. What is it you’ve
found, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind until I show it you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was accordingly agreed that we should the next
morning go and see what Bill had to show, and not
to ask him to say what it was beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the morning Bill woke us, and gave us a
good breakfast of eggs, roast maize, and a grilled fowl;
and when we had finished he said, “Come along, and
see what I have to show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>First he took us to the spring, and showed us how
he had patched up the troughs, cleared out a basin,
and lined it with turtle shells, into which the water
fell, and which was large enough to take a bath in.
Here we all enjoyed a thorough good wash, and sat
in turn under the end of the trough from which the
water fell into the basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill soon got tired of being here, and said, “If I’d
thought that you would have been so long here, I’d
have brought you here last night; now bear a hand,
and come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Getting out of the water, we dried ourselves with
cocoanut fibre, and putting on our clothes we went
on with Bill a short way, until he brought us to a
shed he had made for the fowls, which he had enclosed
with leaf mats; and here he said he had all the
fowls on the island except two or three, and that
some hens were laying regularly, while others were
sitting on their eggs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certain you’re a regular farmer,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit; I’ll show you if I’m a farmer. Come
along here a bit farther.” And following him along, he
brought us to a clearing about twice as large as that
where our hut stood, and which, like it, had been at
one time planted with maize; but here the maize had
been stronger than the weeds, and Bill having torn
up all the latter, there was to be seen enough Indian
corn, nearly ripe, to have loaded the <span class='it'>Escape</span> twice over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are a farmer, surely!” exclaimed both
Tom and myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may say that, but you haven’t seen all yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Not yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by a long chalk. I think the fellow whose hut
we have lived up there by himself, and the others
down here. Come along, and I’ll show you some more
good-luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see here,” he said, when we had gone other
three hundred yards; “the reef’s cut nearly in two by
the sea, and they’ve made a stiff fence right across.
And, look; you see they’ve brought the water right
down here too. Now over this fence there’s three
or four huts, or what was huts; and what d’ye think
there is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we can’t tell. Anything to say what the
wreck was, or anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word or a line, not a scrap of paper; but
there’s five graves, and there’s been somewhere about
eight or so got away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, by counting the bunks in the huts, to be
sure. But, there; you won’t guess what else there is.
There’s a turtle-pond, some half-dozen big turtles in
it, and there’s pigs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pigs! Are you sure?” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure as eggs is eggs,” answered Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we catch any?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Bill. “I daresay we can if
we likes; but I seed some as fat as butter, and an
old sow with a lot of young uns. But that ain’t
all; there’s something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Tell us at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember the writing on the table, and
that we couldn’t find out what ‘money’ meant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly; but what’s that got to do with what
you found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’ve found the money, and a mighty lot
there be, I can tell you. Gold guineas—thousands
of them!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NARROW ESCAPE.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“N</span>onsense, lad,” said Tom. “No craft that
sailed these waters ever had thousands of
guineas aboard of her, seeing as how there isn’t no
use for money in these here parts. All the trade is
with beads and iron and such like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so; but the money’s here, and I found it.
It seems as if the man who lived up in our hut, he
were separated from his mates, and that he had the
money one time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it seems as if he had hidden it under the
fireplace, for there’s a hole under it which would hold
the box I’ve found down here; and that they who
took it went off in a hurry—maybe saw a sail, and
left him and the money behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where is this money? Come along and let
us see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, down in the biggest of them huts there, in
a box tied up with cord; but it’s rotted, and the money
tumbled out at the sides.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i075.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“<span class='it'>There was the box, tied together with string.</span>”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='#tied'>Page 76</a>.</span></p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We at once got over the fence, which we could
easily see had been built to keep the pigs within
bounds, and followed Bill to where there were
standing the remains of some huts, which, as he said,
had been cleared of what would give any clue as
to who the occupants had been; but there, under one
of the bed-places, was <a id='tied'></a>the box, as Seaman had described
it, wrapped up in a piece of sail-cloth, tied
together with island-made string, and the coverings
being more than half rotten, the contents had burst
out, and partly rolled, on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Curious, though the money was safe, and I am sure
a roast sucking pig would have been of much more use
to us than all the gold that ever was coined, it was to
this money we first turned our attention, and agreed
that nothing should be done until it was safely stowed
away—money that had lain for years untouched and
uncared for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pulled out the box, and emptied the coins still
remaining in it into a heap on the ground, and added
to them those which had fallen out, and to our eyes
the pile of gold and silver seemed a mound of inexhaustible
wealth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, we had divided the gold from the
silver, and counted it out as nearly as we were
able, for there were coins of various nations mixed
up with the guineas of which Bill had spoken.
We found that there was about twelve hundred
pounds—a sum far larger than could have been expected
to be found on board a trader in the South
Seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as we had counted out our money, we
began to talk of how we could stow it away; and
after much discussion we decided on carrying it to
the hut where we were living, and putting it in the
dead seaman’s chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we were on our way back with it, just before
we came to the fence, we saw some of the pigs of
which Bill had told us, and I managed to catch a
little squeaker to carry it back for our dinner; but
its cries alarmed the mother, who came after us in hot
haste, and if we had not been on the fence when she
came up she would doubtless have made us pay for
kidnapping her offspring. As it was, she caught hold
of my trousers in her mouth, and would have hauled
me back on top of her if, luckily, they had not been
rather rotten and given way, Mrs. Pig falling back
with a piece of tarry trousers in her mouth, while I
tumbled over on the other side of the fence, by no
means sorry to get off so cheaply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pigling I had caught I had chucked over
before, so all the efforts of the old sow to rescue her
darling child from its fate were fruitless, and we soon
had him stewing in the iron pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he was cooking, we spoke of the money we
had found, and what we should do with it, and
puzzled our heads to know where the schooner had
come from, and what nation she belonged to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We thought she was English by the Bible and
chart, but the money puzzled us more than enough; so
at last we agreed not to bother ourselves about where
it came from any more, and began to build castles in
the air of buying or building a ship, of which Tom
Arbor should be captain, and Bill Seaman and myself
the two mates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst we were yarning away, Bill suddenly said,
“I forgot something I found by the box the money
was in. Look here!” and he pulled out of the breast
of his shirt a small leather bag tied up carefully.
“See,” he said, as he undid it and poured out the
contents; “there’s a lot of pretty beads; pity they
haven’t holes in ’em, or we might string ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they are pretty,” said both Tom and myself,
as we eagerly bent over the little heap of shining
balls; “but ’tis a pity they’re not of a size and
true shaped. I suppose they’re some of the beads
the natives wouldn’t have to do with. Never mind,
we can keep them; there were none like them among
the trade aboard of the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little bag had its contents restored to it, and
was stowed away in the chest with our money, and
we then all concluded it was time for bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By dint of hard work and manœuvring Tom and I,
at the end of ten days more, had got our boat raised
and decked forward and aft, leaving only an open
space amidships in which we could lie down; and in
this we also built a cemented fireplace similar to the
one we had found in the dead man’s hut. Outside
the boat we had also fastened a great, bolster-like
fender of cocoanut fibre, which we served over with
string made of the same material, the whole being
thoroughly soaked in a mixture of cocoanut oil and
hog fat; for Bill, while we were acting as shipwrights,
had been farming and hunting to make provision for
our voyage, and as we said we wanted grease, he had
boiled down the remains of two porkers, of which he
had salted part to furnish us with meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only question now remaining was to rig our
little ship, and this gave rise to endless discussion.
At first we decided on keeping her mizzen as it was,
and altering the torn dipping lug into a jib and
standing lug; but we soon saw that she was now so
much deeper and heavier that this would scarcely
move her except in very heavy weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After much trouble we managed, by fitting her
with a bowsprit and using up all that was not rotten
of the canvas we had found on the island, to give
her a suit of sails for going on a wind, and made
a huge mat of palm leaves for a square-sail to be
set in running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All being completed, we packed on board under
her fore and aft decks a stock of provisions, consisting
of dried and salted pig, turtle flesh, smoked fish, and
maize; while, besides our beakers, we had hundreds
of cocoanut shells full of water, and on deck we
had a coop of a dozen fowls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All being prepared, our stock, according to our
calculations, being enough to last us for at least a
couple of months, we paddled the <span class='it'>Escape</span> out of the
lagoon, and, making sail to a fresh trade wind which
blew on our beam, we steered in the direction of the
nearest island marked on the chart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though we had been now a long time on the
island, and had found a refuge there from starvation
or a still more dreadful death by thirst, we quitted it
without regret, and launched forth on our voyage
into the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to setting our course, at first we had an idea by
the sun by day, and we had learned aboard of the
<span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span> that when the Southern Cross was
vertical it was always due south; but I do not suppose
we were ever accurate within two or three
points either way of south-west, which we aimed at,
and mostly by keeping the wind abeam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Escape</span> made very good weather and steered
easily, but, notwithstanding the size of her patchwork
sails, she did not go fast through the water. “Never
mind, lads,” said Tom, when Bill and I complained of
this; “it’s better than a leaky corner of the forecastle
of the <span class='it'>Fleece</span> to sleep in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and there ain’t no mate to boot us
or bos’n to rope’s-end us here either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and more than that,” cried Bill, who was
superintending the boiling of our pot, in which was a
piece of beautiful pork and some maize, “our tucker
here ain’t mouldy, weevilly biscuit and salt junk
that’s more fit for sole leather than food for humans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, cobbler,” was our answer, and we put
up patiently with the slowness of our progress when
we considered how much better off we were than we
had ever been aboard of the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first day and night and all the next day passed
away without our seeing anything save porpoises,
which gambolled around, looking, as they always do
to my mind, the happiest of created beings, flying-fish,
and silver-winged gulls. But about the middle
of the second night Bill, who had the watch, called
out, “Rouse up, mates; whatever is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and I were awake in a second, and looking
ahead as he told us, we saw a sight which all the
fireworks ever made by the ingenuity of man could not
have equalled. High up in the heavens, blotting out
the stars, was a dense, black cloud, which seemed to
be supported on a pillar or fountain of fire, and from
the cloud were raining down masses of matter white-hot,
red-hot. While we were looking, indeed before
we had properly cleared our eyes of sleep, we heard
a tremendous noise, louder than a thousand claps of
thunder, and the breeze which had been carrying us
steadily along suddenly ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever can that be?” I cried. “A ship
blown up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ship!” answered Tom. “No ship that ever
floated could give a sight like that, nor a clap
neither. That’s a burning mountain. I’ve heard
as there be some in these parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clap succeeded clap, but though all wonderful,
none of them equalled in intensity of the sound the
first one, while the fountain of fire leaped up and
down in the most marvellous manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out, boys; be smart and shorten sail,” said
Tom. “I’ve heard as how there be great waves after
one of these blows-up, and we must keep our craft
bows on if so be as we are not to be swamped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sail was shortened as quickly as we could, and our
well covered over with the canvas to prevent us being
swamped; and then Tom told us to lash ourselves to
the deck, and get our paddles out, while he got the
oar over the stern, so as to be ready to twist the boat
in any direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely were we ready when we heard a low,
moaning sound, and soon saw a wall of water of
appalling height sweeping rapidly towards us. We
worked frantically at oar and paddles, and fortunately
it met us bows on; but so steep was the wave that
we could not rise properly to it, and for what seemed
an appalling time we were buried in the water.
Would our boat free herself and rise again, or would
she sink under the weight, and drag us down with
her to the depths of the ocean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the thoughts which passed through my
mind, and, I doubt not, through the minds of my
companions; but they were answered by our emerging
from the wave with our gunwale broken, but otherwise
uninjured. Our decks proved stanch, and though
the weight of water had beaten the sails down into
the well, which was full, the boat still floated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick! you two unlash yourselves, and bail for
your lives, for there’ll be some more of these waves,
and if she meets them half water-logged as she is,
down to Davy Jones’s locker we go,” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I did not need any second bidding to obey
Tom’s order, while he straightened the boat in the
direction the wave had struck, and we bailed away
for dear life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we were half clear we heard the same sort
of sound as had heralded the first wave, and again we
were struck and half buried by the water; but the
wave was not so high as the first, and we came through
at the cost only of having to bail out more water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each successive wave, for there were a dozen, was
smaller and smaller, and at last the sea became
smooth again, and the trade winds blew once more;
while from the burning mountain, instead of a fountain
of fire and sparks, we could only see the rosy reflection
of flames on rolling masses of white smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon repaired our damage, and made sail with,
as far as we could see, no real harm done save that
the coop with our fowls in it had been washed away,
and the wood we had for our fire was so damp that
it would not light, and we had to make our breakfast
of raw pork and uncooked Indian corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sun rose, we hung up our clothes to dry,
and found that we could still see the column of smoke,
though not the reflection of the flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom steered steadily for this smoke, and when we
asked if we were not running into danger by steering
for the volcano, he comforted us by saying that after
such a blow-up as we’d seen there could be no other
for some time; and, as he understood, these burning
mountains were always in the centre of a group of
islands, and we should be sure to find inhabitants,
and maybe a schooner or ship trading for sandalwood,
bêche de mer, and copra, in which we could get a
passage to China, Australia, or New Zealand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the trade winds blew fresh and the sun
was shining, the whole air seemed to be full of a sort
of brown haze; and we found that our decks, sails,
clothes, hair, in fact everything, were covered with a
fine, brown dust, which settled down on us, and in
such quantities that we had to keep on shovelling
it overboard or we should have sunk under its weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day we sailed on in the direction of the smoke,
and at night we again saw it lighted up by the
reflection of the fire beneath. We were tired and
weary, and though we took it in turns to steer and
look out, the helmsman often found his head bobbing
down on his chest. But in the middle of the night
we were all frightened out of our sleepiness by the
boat striking some hard substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” cried Tom, as he came out of the
well, where he and I had been sleeping. “What have
you run into, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill was as much startled as we were, and as the
bumps were repeated, we concluded it would be best
to shorten sail and wait for daylight, though we at
once sounded, in case we might be near any land, but
found no bottom, though we bent every available bit
of rope on to our leadline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sun rose we saw a strange sight indeed,
for the whole surface of the sea was covered
with floating masses of stone, through which we had
to make our way, two of us standing in the bow to
fend off the lumps as we got close to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, in all my born days I never sailed a boat
among a lot of paving-stones ’afore,” said Tom. “I
suppose they was blowed up out of the mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This made us laugh, but the work of shoving off
the floating pumice stone from the boat was very
severe, and we had several times to shorten sail while
we rested from the labour; but by the middle of the
afternoon the pieces began to get fewer and fewer,
and before sunset the surface of the sea was clear of
them, and we could steer our course without let
or hindrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle watch, under the smoke, I saw (it
was my watch) what looked like a black mass
streaked with threads of fiery gold. And when I was
relieved by Tom, he told me that that must be the
side of the fiery mountain; and sure enough when I
awoke after daylight, there, right ahead of us, towered
a great mountain out of the sea, crowned by a mass
of smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the top the mountain was black and bare, but
lower down its sides were clothed with forests, through
which the liquid fire poured out of the crater had
cut broad gashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, who was steering, was heading away so as to
pass to the north of the island, which we were rapidly
doing; and Bill was lacing some palm-leaf mats together
to set as a square-sail, a task in which I at
once joined him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PURSUED BY CANNIBALS.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>e rapidly “rose” the lower part of the island,
and here and there among the trees we could
see wreaths of silvery smoke, the brown thatch of
native huts, groves of bananas, and clearings, where
the people grew yams and other vegetables. As soon
as we saw this, Bill Seaman and myself were for landing
at once; but a heavy surf which was beating on
the shore prevented this, and Tom said he would not
consent to landing at any place until it was absolutely
necessary to get food or water, unless he saw white
men, for many of the inhabitants of the South Sea
Islands were cannibals, and, if we fell into their
hands, would think nothing of killing and eating us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We skirted along the northern shore, and soon saw
that Tom had been right in saying that the burning
mountain was probably in the middle of a group of
islands, for by mid-day we could see the tops of
other islands away to the northward and westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now debated what we should do, and after
much argument decided we should coast along the
shore of the large island of which the fiery mountain
formed the centre, and look for some signs of the
house of a trader or missionary; and if we saw one,
to land there at once and make known our story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the lee-side of the island we found there was
no surf, but the shore sloped down into the sea, fringed
by a belt of sand of silvery whiteness, the outline
being here and there broken by small creeks running
up inland; but the fair beauty of the scene was marred
by broad scars where the liquid fire from the mountain
was pouring into the sea, and by patches where
tree, shrub, and hut had been involved in one common
ruin and buried in ashes and cinders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the streams of molten lava pouring into the
sea caused clouds of white steam to rise, and made
the water so hot for a considerable distance that the
fish had all been killed, and were floating on the surface
half cooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the meeting of fire and water we gave a wide
berth, skirting round the line of steam and heat,
though we managed to pick up some of the half-cooked
fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after passing this we lost the wind, being cut
off from the trades by the bulk of the mountain, and
having to resort to our paddles to get the <span class='it'>Escape</span>
along, which was slow and tedious work; and though
we saw among the trees several villages composed of
huts which consisted only of roofs without any walls,
we saw nowhere any signs of the habitations of either
missionary or trader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the afternoon we saw an entrance to
a creek between two overhanging rocks, and after
much thought we decided that we would run the
risk of putting in there for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before paddling in we loaded our muskets and
looked to their priming, in case we should be attacked;
but as we got inside the entrance, we saw
there were no signs of any inhabitants. So, tying our
boat up to the trunk of a tree close to the right-hand
rock, we landed, and gave our legs a stretch along the
beach, for we had found ourselves much cramped by
the close quarters aboard of our little craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as we had, as Bill said, got the kinks out
of our legs, Tom set us to work to clear out and
restow our stores, which had been pretty well tossed
about while we were passing through the waves
caused by the explosions of the volcano and the consequent
earthquakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found, indeed, that it was fortunate we had
come in, for the greater portion of our stock of
fresh water had been spoiled or capsized, and we
took some time in replenishing it from a spring, and
it was quite dark before we had got all things to
rights and restowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I and Bill were about to light a fire on the beach
to cook our supper, when Tom said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For goodness’ sake, don’t be such fools; we don’t
know nothing of what sort of folks there be in the
island, and if they see fire we may have a lot of
murdering cannibals down atop of us afore ever we
know where we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s cold, mate, and I want to roast some
corn. It’s bad eating dry corn, like a horse,” said
Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true,” said Tom; “but I fancy there’s a sort
of cave just here, and we can make a fire inside and
sleep there warm and comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where away, Tom?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not thirty fathoms away. Now, come on, as I
marked it;” and following Tom we came to a hole
in the rock which was almost hidden by a mass of
creepers, and drawing them aside he told one of us
to go in with an armful of dry leaves and set them
on fire to see what it was like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Bill and I were too much afraid to go into
the cave in the dark, for fear we might come across
some wild beast; so Tom, laughing at our fears, stooped
down and went in alone. He soon had a fire of dry
leaves burning, and called us to come, for there was
no danger; and now that there was a light we did
not hesitate, and found ourselves in a cave about
twenty feet long by twelve wide and seven high, the
floor of which was covered with fine, dry, white sand,
while the roof and walls were of a dark, rough rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, mates,” said Tom; “there’s a bedroom fit
for a king. Now, as we’re near men, we can’t all
sleep at once; so as soon as we’ve had our supper
we’ll settle about watches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill said that as he was cook he would have the
morning, and Tom agreed that he should keep the
first and I the middle watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I were soon asleep, for we were thoroughly
tired; and I believe that Tom took pity on us both,
for when he roused me out I am sure that the greater
part of the night had passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been walking up and down between the
cave and the boat, carrying a musket, and told me to
do the same, and to be careful to notice the smallest
sounds. I said I would, and he then pointed out the
position of the Southern Cross, and where it should
reach before I called Bill, and went to his well-earned
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I walked up and down as I was told, though I
must confess that I felt a most undeniable longing to
sit down; but as, when I once leaned up against a
palm tree, I found that I began to nod and dropped
my musket, I refrained, and walked up and down
steadily until the Southern Cross told me it was time
to rouse Bill out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He protested that he had only just lain down, and
would not believe that the time for his watch had
come; and it was not until I threatened to douse him
with cold water that he would turn out and relieve
me. I gave him the same orders as Tom had given
me, and warned him to be specially careful when he
made up the fire, so that no smoke should escape out
of our cave, lest it might be seen by the natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lay down again as soon as he was on watch, and
was asleep in a moment. From my sleep I was
awaked by Tom shouting out, “What’s up? There’s
a musket-shot!” and we both rushed out of the cave,
and found that Bill was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and I at once seized our muskets, saw that
the boat was ready to shove off at a moment’s notice,
and called out to Bill to know where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost directly afterwards we saw a man running
towards us, who fell down at our feet and caught
hold of our knees; and then, before we could make
out what it meant, we heard another shot, and saw
Bill burst from some trees near, his musket in his
hands still smoking, and crying, “Jump into the boat
and shove off; there are a whole heap of people
after me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all jumped into the boat, followed by the
stranger, who had nothing on him but a necklace
of sharks’ teeth and shells, who said, “Plenty bad
mans want kiki<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We seized our paddles, and began to pull out of
the creek, and were only just in time; for some twenty
men, armed with spears and arrows, came rushing on
the beach and let fly at us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our new companion seized a musket and fired
at them in return, knocking over a great big fellow
who seemed to be the leader. This stopped them for
a moment, but evidently they did not mean to let us
off easily, for half a dozen or more plunged into the
water and began to swim after us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We paddled away for dear life, but the swimmers
swam so fast that we saw they would soon catch us
up unless something stopped them. “Pull, lads, pull
for your lives!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” said Bill, “pull all you know. They’re
murdering cannibals, and had killed one man, and
were going to kill this fellow, when I shot one who
was going to knock him over the head with a big
club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pulled with all our might, and got out from
between the two rocks, with the swimmers only two
or three fathoms astern of us, and straining every
nerve to catch us up. It was fortunate for us in one
way that they were so close, for their friends ashore
were afraid to shoot their arrows at us, for fear of
hitting their comrades in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man Bill had rescued wanted to fire another
shot, saying, “Plenty bad mans. Kill white man.
Kiki them. Kiki white Mary<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> three moons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, however, said he would not fire again unless
it was necessary, and told the stranger to take my
paddle, while I reloaded the muskets that had been
fired, and came aft to be ready to resist any man
that might catch hold of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old boat went through the water as fast as
my companions could urge her; but still the swimmers
gained, and presently the <a id='man'></a>leading man took a tomahawk
from his belt and hurled it at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I had not seen it I should not have believed
that a swimmer could have thrown a weapon with
such force. It came flying straight at me, and if I
had not dodged, it would have struck me dead; but
it buried itself in our deck without doing harm to
any of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I fire, Tom?” I called out. “There’s another
going to throw at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said; “but take a careful aim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I raised the musket to my shoulder, and aimed at
a man who had raised himself up to throw his tomahawk,
but I could scarcely bring myself to press the
trigger to take away a man’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I did, the man hurled his tomahawk at me,
which struck the musket out of my hands, and it fell
overboard, going off as it did so without harm to any
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Sam, that’ll never do,” said Tom; “take
hold of my oar,” and he picked up another musket,
and taking steady aim fired, and wounded the man
who was now in front of the other swimmers, and
not more than nine feet away from us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companions took no notice of the wounded
man, and still pressed on in chase; so Tom fired
again, and wounded another. Even this did not stop
them; and although he wounded one more, the others
managed to get up and catch hold of the boat.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We all boated our paddles and seized upon the
muskets, which we clubbed, and beat our assailants
off; but one managed to get a footing on board, and
seized upon the man whom we had rescued, and endeavoured
to stab him with a knife made of hoop-iron.
We were still busy beating off the others, and
had neither time nor opportunity to help our new
friend; but just as we had finished repulsing our
other assailants, and were turning to come to his
assistance, we saw that he had managed to wrest
the knife from his opponent, and giving him two
savage stabs he thrust him overboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We again bent to our paddles, our guest telling us
in broken English to pull away from the island and
steer for one which he pointed out down to leeward.
We soon got out from under the lee of the island,
and made all sail in the given direction, and then
began to ask Bill how all the trouble began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mates, you know how as I had the morning
watch; and when Sam roused me out, I took the
musket and marched up and down like a sojer on
sentry-go, and heard never a sound, till just about
when it began to get light I thought I would go up
above the creek for a bit and look about. Well, so I
went up through some trees, and then I came to a
sort of a path, and went along for a matter of two or
maybe three hundred yards, and then I thought I
heard some men a-talking. I drops down at once on
all fours, and begins to creep along towards them
through the bushes; and I comes after a bit to the
edge of an open space in the midst of which there
was a big tree, and under the tree was an open hut
in which there were an idol a-standing, with necklaces
and all manner of things on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In front of the hut there were a fire burning and
a matter of thirty or forty men around it, and some
one were cutting up a dead man, and two other bodies
was a-lying on the ground, and this chap here were
tied up to a post. I didn’t feel over comfortable, and
thought as how I’d better be making tracks for the
boat, when I sees one of the cannibals cut this fellow
adrift and bring him out in the middle, and was just
a-going to knock him on the head, when I fires and
he falls. Our chum here he runs to me, and we both
runs as hard as we could with all the other chaps
after us hot-foot, and I a-ramming a cartridge into
my gun, and so down we comes. And when I’d loaded
I turned round, and then I sees a big chap close after
me with a spear; so I up and let fly at him so close
as I almost touched him. And then as he falls I run
again and finds you and the boat all ready, and
Johnny here aboard of her. And the rest—why,
mates, you knows it as well as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank ye, Bill,” said Tom. “It’s lucky it’s all
figured out as it has, and we’ve saved Johnny’s life,
as you call him; but mind, you had no business to go
cruising about when you were on the lookout, and
next time as it happens Sam here and I will have to
reckon with you for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Bill had been telling his story, the man he
had rescued was sitting down looking alternately at
the island we had left and the one we were steering
for, and gnawing away at a piece of pork we had
given him in a manner that showed that at all events
his appetite had not been impaired by the narrow
shave he had had of being killed and eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Johnny,” said Tom; “you savey English.
You spin us your yarn, and tell us who you are, and
where you hail from, and what brought you into
the fix you were in.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“C</span>ertain, sir, me speak Englis’; me live along
a white man two yam time; me talky all
proper.” And then, as if to prove his intimate
acquaintance with our language, he gave a volley
of oaths, which for piquancy and nautical flavour it
would be hard to surpass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, stow that, mate; we want no swearing in
this craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi! what? You be missionally man—no speak
’trong? Englis’ man, ’Mellican man, he speak people
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind; just talk without any Englis’ man
or ’Mellican man palaver, as you call it. Who
are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Why, me be one big man, son one chief.
Fader he name Wanga; me him name Calla. Fader
he lib along of there,” pointing to the island we
were steering for. “Aneitou him name. One white
he stay there comprar<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> copra, bechmer, shell—all
kind. Now one moon and one bit, me come to here
for find copra, slug, sandalwood, and make plenty
trade what time mountain he blow. Dem island
nigger say he be me, and catch me” (and on his fingers
he counted carefully). “Two ten and two men live
along of me. Plenty kiki. Kiki one and two ten,
and then come where him boy come. Kill one man,
two man, and make right kill me, when white boy
he shoot, and nigger he tumble so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, in your island—Aneitou, you call
it—you say there’s a white man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One man live there many yam time, and what
time ship come plenty square gin. My! den he
drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When does a ship come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometime one yam time, sometime two, sometime
three yam time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, mates, there’s a chance. A ship looks in
once in one, two, or three years; and I suppose this
white man is some drunken old beach-comber. Anyway,
we won’t be eaten there,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you looking at, Johnny,” interrupted
Bill, for he noticed that Calla was evidently anxiously
looking at the island we had left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be still, white man. Man flog war-drum for
fight. Me look see where war-canoe come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” we cried all together; “a war-canoe in
chase of us! Do you see one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, me no see; but me sabey what time man flog
war-drum, all same that. Plenty soon all man go
for war-canoe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had not noticed any sound; but now, listening
intently, we could catch a few weird notes drifting
down the wind towards us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him plenty bad,” said Calla. “Him call five
plenty big canoe. One canoe him have men four
ten, five ten; come along plenty quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope the wind’ll hold, lads,” said Tom; “these big
canoes go as fast as a ship with stuns’ls both sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though we were tired, we got out our paddles and
oar, and rigged up another mat or two as studding-sails,
so as to make as much headway as possible, and
get within sight of Aneitou, whose people Calla told
us would send out their canoes to meet those from
the volcanic island, if they saw them coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We paddled and pulled, taking turns to steer, Calla
doing yeoman service at a paddle; but after an hour
or so, during which we had made some ten or twelve
miles, and were about half-way across, we could hear
the sounds of the war-drums astern of us. Calla laid
in his paddle, and wanted to climb up our mast; but
Tom pulled him down, for fear of capsizing the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me want see how many canoe come. Plenty big
chief live along of they. Big drum, big god, they
bring in canoe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind now, Johnny; wait a bit. We’ll be
able to see them from the deck soon. Paddle away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We kept on, straining every nerve, and the breeze
fortunately freshening we made good way towards
Aneitou; but the sound of the war-drums of our
pursuers became louder and louder, and soon Calla,
jumping up again, declared he could see them coming,
and made us understand that before ever we could
reach Aneitou they would be up with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, I say, Johnny,” I asked, “where are your
canoes from your island? They must hear the
drums now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla answered, “That live for true; but s’pose hear
drum—man run one side, where canoe he be, and
men make get bow and spear, make long time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give way, lads,” said Tom. “It’s no use wasting
our breath talking. The nearer we get to this fellow’s
island, the better chance we have. It’s a bad business,
Sam, that you let that musket fall overboard. We
have none now for Calla, who could use one well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, when he had said this, paddled away some
time in silence, Bill pulling the oar, and I steering;
but the sound of the drums of our pursuers came
nearer, and at last Tom said, “I can stand this no
longer,” and laying in his paddle looked to the loading
of our muskets, and cutting up some bullets into
quarters he put them in on the top of the ordinary
charge, and saw that the flints were properly fixed
and touch-holes clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had done this he stood up and said, “I
can see the canoes now. There are five, as Calla
said—great big double ones; and besides the men
paddling, there are a lot of chaps up on a great
platform amidships.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long before they’ll be up with us?” I asked.
“Can we fetch Aneitou before they catch us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked round and said, “I scarcely dare say
that. There’s a point as runs out, where maybe we
might do it; but there’s such a surf a-tumbling on it
as would smash up us and the <span class='it'>Escape</span>, and all
belonging to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a good look, mate, and see if there mayn’t
be a break in the surf,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla, who had been listening to what we were
saying, now got up and stood alongside Tom, and
pointed out what to him had been undistinguishable—half
a dozen black spots falling and rising on
the surface of the sea near the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, them be Aneitou canoe. White man he
come along of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you tell?” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me sabey him canoe.” And then looking to
windward at our pursuers, Calla said, “Now plenty
soon big corroboree. Aneitou men and Paraka men”
(Paraka was the name of the volcanic island) “come
all one time to we.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull away lads, pull away,” cried Tom; “as Calla
says, we shall be saved yet, though I must own I
thought at one time we should be caught. I own it
ain’t so much the being killed I don’t like, as the
being eaten after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what difference can that make?” said Bill
and I together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know as it makes any difference,
but I owns as I should like to be buried shipshape
and Bristol fashion, sewed up in a hammock with a
twenty-four pound shot at my feet and a stitch
through my nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we pulled along after this discussion, the drums
of our pursuers sounded closer and closer; and presently,
mingled with their deep boom, we could hear the
war-song of the men who occupied their fighting-decks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked round and saw astern of us, not more than
five hundred yards away, the five great double canoes,
with their lofty prows ornamented with human hair,
skulls, and mother-of-pearl, while high up on their
platforms, surrounded by warriors armed with spears
and bows, were the sacred drums, on which fellows
fantastically painted in white, red, and yellow were
vigorously beating a kind of tune, to which the
paddles kept time, making their strange craft fly
through the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as I could make out, there were about
thirty paddles in each of the canoes, and some twenty
warriors on the platform; so that fifty men, as Calla
had said, were about the complement of each canoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Tom,” I said, “do shoot at them; they’re
so close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, mate; wait a bit. We shouldn’t do them
no harm now, and every inch brings us nearer to
Calla’s friends. Hark! don’t you hear their drums
and war-song now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly the sound came up to us against the
wind, and looking in that direction I saw the six
canoes Calla had said were coming to our relief
paddling up against wind and sea in a smother of
foam, while from a pole on board one of them there
floated a tiny flag, which I could not distinguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla, when he heard the sound of the drums and
songs of his fellow-islanders, laid in his paddle, and
seizing on an axe and knife commenced a dance in
which he defied his late captors, accompanying it
with screeches and howls of which I should have
thought no human throat could be capable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closer and closer drew the canoes from Paraka,
but still faster did we run down on those from
Aneitou; and before Tom thought it well to open fire
on our pursuers, we were passing through the fleet of
our friends. And on the deck of the one on which we
had seen the pole and flag, which we now made out
to be an English red ensign, we could see mounted
a small cannon, and standing by its breech a white
man with a lighted match in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hailed us as we passed to shorten sail and
round to, and, if we had muskets, to open fire on the
men of Paraka; and almost immediately his cannon
rang out, pouring death and destruction amid the
crew of the biggest of his opponents’ canoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We doused the mats we had as studding-sails, and
took in our other sails; but by the time we had done
so, we were at least a quarter of a mile from the two
fleets of canoes, which had now met and grappled, and
all whose occupants were by this time engaged in
deadly conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mates,” said Tom, “I suppose we must go
and lend a hand. There’s hot work going on there,
and it’s only fair that we should help those who came
out to help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No urging on his part was necessary, and we
buckled to to pull back to where the fight was going
on; but before we could reach the scene of conflict the
fortune of the day had declared pretty decisively in
favour of our friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canoe which carried the white man had
riddled one of the hulls of the double canoe carrying
the leader of the men of Paraka, and in sinking it
had so dragged down its twin that the whole fabric
had capsized, and her crew, or such of them as were
still alive, were struggling in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla was mad with desire for fight, and it was
not long before we got up near to the canoes. At first
Tom thought it would be best to lay off and use our
muskets, but we could not distinguish friend from
foe; so, arming ourselves with trade hatchets stuck
in our belts, we laid our boat alongside the canoe on
board which the Englishman was, and springing on
board, made our painter fast round one of her stern
heads, and then forced our way to where our countryman
was fighting at the head of his followers. But
by the time we had reached him the men of Paraka
had had enough, and two of their canoes, which were
able to do so, sought safety in flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others remained in the hands of the men of
Aneitou, who secured such of the occupants as were
still alive with lashings of sinnet, and then looked
after their own dead and wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the Paraka men seemed to prefer to trust
themselves to the waves to remaining in the hands of
their enemies; but they gained little by doing so, for
volleys of arrows were fired at them as they swam,
and some of the more eager of the warriors of Aneitou
plunged into the water in pursuit, and the conflict
which had ended in the canoes began afresh in
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla, with cries of joy, rushed to an old man, who
was in full war-paint, and whose necklaces and
bracelets of shells and beads and lofty head-dress of
feathers seemed to denote a chief, and who held in
his hand a rugged club, clotted with brains and gore,
and kneeling down before him began a long and
voluble speech, pointing the while to the two fugitive
canoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old chief was none other than Calla’s father,
Wanga, and he raised up his son, and calling to some
of his men gave orders which we could not understand,
but of which the purport was soon evident, for
the two least damaged of the canoes of Aneitou were
hastily manned with unwounded crews, and their
fighting-decks filled with warriors, among whom
Calla took a prominent position, being easily distinguished,
he alone being unadorned with war-paint;
and soon these two were darting over the waves in
pursuit of the beaten and flying men of Paraka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this was going on, we were speaking to the
white man, who, when we came to where he was
standing, said, “Why, where on earth did ye drop
from? A shipwreck, I s’pose. How long ago?
Ye’ve rigged that craft of yours up on some island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom told him our story in as few words as he
could, and said how thankful we were to have met
him, and be rescued from being killed, cooked, and
eaten, which would doubtless have been our fate if
we had fallen into the hands of the Paraka cannibals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ’ud be about your lot anywheres here, for
all of ’em eat men; only as how as you’ve brought off
Calla, and his father’s a big man in his island, you
may be safe for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but how do you live among them? Why
haven’t they eaten you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve been too useful to ’em for ’em to want
to eat me; and, besides, an old shellback such as I am
would be too tough to make anything but soup of.
But now, mates, let’s be getting home again; and when
we come to my shanty, which is just behind the point
where the canoes came from, we can have a palaver,
and overhaul all our logs. I’ll come along of you in
your craft and pilot you in. Can you stow a couple
or four black fellows and their paddles? They’ll help
you along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We eagerly agreed to the help of the natives, who
with their great carved paddles certainly added much
to our speed.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BRISTOL BOB.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“W</span>ell, this here be a queer craft, and no
mistake,” said our new friend, who told us
his name was “Bristol Bob,” or “Bob” for short,
when he had squatted down on the after-deck alongside
of Tom, who was steering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, mates, fighting’s thirsty work; haven’t you
ever a drop to drink,” asked Bristol Bob, “and a bit
of bacca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I at once got him a drink of water, and said I’d
hunt up some tobacco and a pipe for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Water, lad? Well, I’ll have a drink; but haven’t
you got anything better—no rum nor square gin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a bottle of spirits, which we have kept;
but it’s stowed away, and I can’t get it out unless we
unstow the whole boat,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” replied Bristol Bob, “I can do
without it till we land. Fancy, lads, it’s three months
since I’ve had a tot of grog, and till another trader
comes round I shall have to go thirsty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All three of us—Tom, Bill, and myself—did not
much care about this, for on board the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span>
we had seen quite enough of the evils of drunkenness,
and looked at each other rather gloomily. But all of
a sudden I noticed that Bristol Bob’s shirt was
stained with blood, and said to him,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re wounded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, lad,” he said, “I believe I am; but you
won’t think much of such a scratch as that when
you’ve been knocking about as many years as
I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and I, however, insisted on examining his
wound while Bill steered, and pulling off his shirt we
found under his left arm a small, punctured wound
from which the blood was oozing slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Tom, “it don’t seem much; it ain’t
more than a prick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the natives, however, who was watching
what we were about, when he saw the wound, looked
grave, and laying his paddle in, came and looked
at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something to Bristol Bob which we did not
understand, but as soon as he heard it the latter said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it don’t look much, but it may give me my
walking ticket. Here, take my knife—it’s sharp
enough; and if you can feel anything inside, cut it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom felt carefully round the wound, and after
some little time said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel something like a splinter here, about an
inch and a half from the hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it out, then,” said Bristol Bob. “Don’t be
afeared, but cut well in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom said he hardly liked to do so, but the wounded
man insisted; so Tom cut in carefully, and found imbedded
in the flesh a splinter of bone as sharp as a
needle and two inches long, which he drew out and
gave to his patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he said, “ ’tis as I thought. It’s one of they
bone-pointed arrows has struck me, and they’s woundy
poisonous things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had now taken off my own shirt, which was but
a ragged garment, and begun to tear it into strips to
bind the wound up, but Bristol Bob said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, lad; don’t bind it up yet. We’ll burn it a bit
first to get the poison out. Have you a cartridge
handy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes,” I said. “What do you want
done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just empty the powder into the cut, and set it
alight, and you may give me the bullet to chew the
while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I and Tom looked aghast at this proposal; but
Bristol Bob insisted, and laid himself down so that the
powder could be put in the wound, and taking the
bullet in his mouth he told us to fire it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rolled about and groaned while the powder was
fizzing and sputtering, but less than we had expected;
and when it was burned out he gave a long breath,
and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can lash it up now, and put some oil or
grease on it, if you have any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, we had brought a little cocoanut oil
from Ring Island with us, and soaking some rag in
this we put it over the burnt wound, and lashed it in
place as well as we were able.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time this was done we were past the point
from which the canoes had put out, and saw behind it
a large bay, in one corner of which was a little island
some three hundred yards long and a hundred wide,
on which was a hut with whitewashed walls standing
in the middle of a grove of bananas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s my shanty, lads,” said Bristol Bob, who
was smoking his pipe as if nothing was the matter
with him. “I finds it best to be away from the
mainland, for none of these people is to be trusted
over much; though for the matter of that water don’t
make much matter to them, for they swims like
fishes. Up there,” he said, pointing to the other side
of the bay, “is Wanga’s village—there where you see
the cocoanuts growing in a cluster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We steered for Bristol Bob’s island, and found
behind it a perfectly secure anchorage for the <span class='it'>Escape</span>,
and moored her carefully, and cleared out all her cargo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bristol Bob told us we were welcome to quarters in
his house, which consisted of two rooms, one of which
was locked up, being a store, and the other, twelve
feet by twenty, was the living-room and bedroom
all in one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close by were half a dozen native huts, which were
only like thatched roofs resting on the ground, without
walls, and open at both ends, in which lived some of
the natives who were in his employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men, except those who had come back in the
<span class='it'>Escape</span> with us, were away in the war-canoes; but a
dozen women and a lot of children were about, and
soon carried up our traps to the house, where we
found Bristol Bob lying down on his bed groaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you very bad?” said Tom. “What can we
do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nought,” he replied. “It’s only the pain of the
burn. But where’s that bottle of grog you spoke
about? I’ll have a tot, and that maybe will send
me to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried to dissuade him from drinking while he
was suffering from his wound, but it was of no avail.
He possessed himself of our bottle, and drank more
than half of it, with the addition of very little water;
and then he put the bottle under his head, saying
that it would be handy if he was thirsty, and soon
after fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was a queer place. In each corner was
a sort of bed-place furnished with blankets and rugs,
on one of which Bristol Bob was sleeping. In the
middle was a rude table, not over clean, which, with
some stools and chests, completed the furniture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stowed away our belongings, and then, being
somewhat hungry, we thought of getting something to
eat, and went outside to find a place where we could
cook; but one of the women, when she saw us
making a fire, made signs that she had something
ready for us, and brought in a large tin dish, in which
was a sort of stew of fowls and salt pork, and two
great yams which had been roasted in the ashes, and
put them on the table, with some salt and capsicums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she left us when she had placed the food on the
table, we supposed we should have to eat, as we had
hitherto been doing, with our knives, and from the
common dish; but Bill, who was always looking into
holes and corners, found a sort of cupboard in one
corner of the room in which were some coarse delft
plates, steel forks, and pewter spoons, and also some
drinking-vessels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are. We can eat more respectably
now,” said Bill. “But, hark! what’s that noise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boom, boom, boom, came the sound of the huge
drums of the natives, and mingling with their notes
were shouts of revelry and shrieks of horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bristol Bob, who had been sleeping, breathing hard
and uneasily, began to move and toss on his bed, and
presently sat up and stared around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” he said. “The death-drums
they’re beating for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom at once went up to him and asked him how
he was, and if he could do anything for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” said the sick man, whose eyes
were now lighted up with the glare of fever.
“Where do you come from?” And then, putting his
hand under the pillow, he seized upon the bottle, and
putting it to his lips took a long draught which
almost emptied it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” he said, “I have it. Calla and Wanga are
having a feast, and they’ll murder and eat me. Come;
there’s not a moment to be lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he said this, Bristol Bob sprang from his couch;
and seizing an axe which hung on the wall above it,
he rushed out of his hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed him, wondering what he intended to
do, and quickly as he went we were close on his
heels, as he made his way to a small mound some
thirty yards away. Here he stopped, and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha! they shan’t eat me yet,” and then stooping
down he began to clear away some leaves and
wood, and disclosed a small door set in the ground
and framed with stout posts. This he opened, and
disclosed a passage dug in the ground, down which he
went, followed by Bill and me; while Tom, who feared
that Bristol Bob’s ravings might have some meaning,
stopped behind to close and bar the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the passage we came into a chamber
about twelve feet square every way, and here the
wounded man struck a light with a flint and steel,
and lighted a rude cocoanut-oil lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By its feeble rays we could see that here were
stowed away four or five kegs and a couple of small
boxes. On one of the latter the madman, for Bristol
Bob, from the combined effects of spirits and fever,
was now no better than a maniac, placed the lamp,
and then, with his axe, stove in the head of one of
the kegs, which to our horror we saw was full of gun-powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The powder he poured on the floor near the other
kegs, and then loosened their staves by a blow from
his axe, so that the powder they contained would mix
with that he had poured on the ground; and then he
stood up and laughed as he rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They think they’ll eat Bristol Bob? Not if I
knows it. I’ll blow myself up first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I stood aghast at his proceedings, and even
watched Bristol Bob reach for his lamp to light the
powder without interfering or moving, when Tom,
who had secured the door, came down the passage, and
saw at a glance what was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without any pause or hesitation he dashed at the
madman, and snatched the lamp away and blew it
out. Bristol Bob, with a roar like a wild beast,
seized the smouldering wick, and threw it on the
powder, where it lay smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, who was struggling with Bristol Bob, shouted
to us to take the wick off the powder, or we should
be all blown up. I was so unmanned by terror that
I covered my eyes and waited for the explosion,
paralyzed with fear, and Bill has since owned to me
that he was as frightened as I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time passed, and no explosion took place, though
we could hear the sound of the struggles of Tom and
Bristol Bob as they rolled on the ground, and the cries
of the former to take the wick off the powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding that we were not blown up, I uncovered my
eyes, and saw the wick still lying on the powder, a
dull red spot covered with grey ash at the end of it;
and mustering up all my resolution I stooped down,
caught it away, and extinguished it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” I heard Tom say. “Here, one of
you, help me with this fellow—he’s most too much
for me; and the other go up and unbar the door,
and let’s get out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to Tom’s help, and together we managed to
get Bristol Bob down, while Bill went up and unbarred
and opened the door; and then, coming down to
our assistance, he helped to drag the poor fellow back
to his hut, where we placed him on his bed, and tied
his hands and feet to prevent his doing any more
mischief. But now he seemed in a sort of stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This done, Tom replaced the dressing on his wound,
and told Bill and me to go back and close and cover
up the door of the place where the powder was.
When this was done we came back to the hut. We
found Tom sitting down with his elbows on his knees,
and holding his head between his hands, while Bristol
Bob moaned wearily on his couch; and always we
heard the weird sound of the native drums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke to Tom two or three times before he
looked up, and when he did he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make it out why the powder did not fire.
It must have been damp or something; but anyway,
’tis only by the mercy of God we have been saved.
Let us kneel down and thank Him for preserving us
from great peril, and implore Him to guard us in the
future as He has done in the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we had finished, I said to him,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it that you are so different from all other
sailors? On board the <span class='it'>Fleece</span>, from the captain downwards,
every one but you swore and used bad
language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not from all other sailors, Sam. I learned it
aboard of my first ship. Her captain was really a
good man; but there’s no time to talk of these matters
now. I doubt not that Bristol Bob’s madness had
some reason in it, and that over at the chief’s village
there’s murder and all sorts of horrors going on. The
sound of them drums goes right through me. Now,
if the idea gets in the savages’ heads to come after
us, I don’t believe Calla nor Wanga nor any of their
chiefs could hinder them, so we must keep a good
lookout. I wish they had brought back the little
cannon that was in the canoe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose they’d do?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, they might kill and eat us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really. Why can’t we get down to the
<span class='it'>Escape</span> and get away while it’s dark?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! with all our provisions and water ashore,
and leave this poor fellow here?” said Tom. “No, we
must keep a good lookout until they’re all quiet, and
then to-morrow we can make our plans for going
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as we were speaking, the drums were beaten
with less fury, and the shouts of the natives were less
noisy and frequent; and after about another half-hour
they ceased altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Tom, “you two fellows go to sleep.
I’ll look after the sick man to see if he wants anything.
He seems pretty quiet now, so I’ll unlash his
hands and feet.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A SAD EVENT.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span> was so thoroughly tired that I fell asleep at
once, and slept soundly; and when I woke it
was already broad daylight, and as I opened my eyes
I saw a tall form bending over me with a face
painted red and white in broad, horizontal stripes,
and thought that cannibals were coming to kill and
eat me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sprang up with a yell, and called to Tom and Bill
that our hour was come, and that I was being killed.
However, I was relieved by the painted face which
had so frightened me relaxing into a broad grin, and
hearing Calla say, for it was he,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for you make big bobbery all same man
die? Me Calla.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked round. Tom
was sitting by Bristol Bob’s side, who was tossing
restlessly on his bed and groaning, and Bill was at
the door of the hut washing himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla had come over from the mainland of Aneitou
to inquire after us, and to say that his father, Wanga,
wished us to come over to his village in the course of
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got up and went over to where Bristol Bob was
lying, followed by Calla, who, looking at him,
said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What make him sick? Plenty time him drink
no be like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom explained as well as he was able how we had
found that the patient was wounded, and the subsequent
treatment, and how he had drunk a whole
bottle of spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make see what thing make hole,” said Calla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, after some little hunting about, found the
splinter of bone which he had cut out in the corner
of one of his pockets, and gave it to Calla, who
examined it eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some minutes he said, pointing to the
wounded man,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him lib for die. Piece along of him inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” said Tom; “is there a bit inside him
yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You watch,” said Calla; and giving a whistle, a
man who had come over to the little islet with him
came into the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him Calla said something, and he went away,
but presently returned, bringing with him a quiver
made of basket-work ornamented with shells and
sharks’ teeth, which he gave to Calla, who opened it
and carefully drew an arrow tipped with a splinter
of bone, and putting the piece that had been cut out
of Bristol Bob by it, said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see make same here,” pointing to the middle
of the head of the arrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking carefully, we saw that the bone tip in its
entirety was about four inches long, and beautifully
worked up, so that the end of it, for more than an
inch, was scarcely thicker than a pin, and that then
it was cut nearly through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see him piece?” pointing to this long thin
part. “Live along Bob. Him die for sure. Plenty
bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we cut it out as we did the other?” asked
Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No pican white man,” said Calla. “Him along a
bone. No can see or catch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sentence of death passed upon the poor fellow
affected us very much, and we were intensely disgusted
when Calla quite coolly proposed to knock him on the
head at once, as he would suffer great pain, and would
not again recover consciousness, or, as Calla put it,
“Peak along man sabey it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this, of course, we would not consent, and also
told Calla that we could not leave the wounded man
to go and see his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla seemed very much displeased about this, and
said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make plenty bobbery along man no lib. He no
fit for kiki. What you want?” But seeing that
we were determined to remain, he went away and
left us to ourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much civilization about that fellow,” I said.
“Although he makes out he ‘live along of white man
plenty time,’ I believe he’s just as big a cannibal as
the rest of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tom. “And though he may think for
a time of our having saved his life, if it runs with his
interests to kill us after a time, he will do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this we afterwards found we wronged poor Calla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mate,” I said, “what are we to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, first and foremost, we must look after this
poor fellow, and when he’s dead, bury him decent
like; and after that we must see about getting away.
I daresay somewhere down these islands we may find
a missionary settlement or a decent trader; anyways,
we mustn’t let these people think we’re going, or
they’ll find means to stop us. Now, one of you go
and find the old woman that gave us supper last
night, and make her understand we should like some
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went out to look for the woman, and found that
now several men had come to the island, who were
the husbands of the women we had seen the day
before; and one of them, who possessed a very scanty
stock of English, informed me he was “Massa’s bos’n,”
and that the others were his “sailor men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bos’n, as he was always called, when I said we
wanted “kiki,” called to some women, and I soon had
the satisfaction of seeing the cooking operations in
full progress, and then followed Bos’n to a place where
he was evidently very anxious that I should come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge of my surprise, on reaching the spot, which
was on the shore of the islet, to find, under a thatched
roof which covered her, and in a dock cut out of the
coral rock, a cutter of about seven tons, with a mast
fitted to lower and raise like that of a Thames
barge, and with all her sails, spars, and rigging carefully
stowed and in good order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such a craft I knew that one could easily make a
voyage of almost any distance; and lifting up a hatch
that covered a sort of well, I found that her below-deck
arrangements were as good as those above, and that she
had a couple of eighteen-gallon casks for storing water,
while on her deck were ring-bolts and fittings for a
small gun—doubtless the one which Bristol Bob had
taken with him in the war-canoe in the fight against
the people of Paraka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full of this discovery, I hastened back to the hut,
and told my companions of it. They were both
delighted, and said that we should, if necessary, be
able to make our escape in her more comfortably and
easily than in our old craft, which was but a clumsy
contrivance after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While we were talking, Bristol Bob raised himself
up in his bed, and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo! Who are you, and what d’ye want?
What ship d’ye come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom at once asked him if he did not remember
the fight of the day before, and his being wounded.
After some time he said he did, and then Tom told
him of what Calla said about his wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, just have a look, will you? But I expects
I has my walking ticket anyways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom took the dressings off the wound; but it was
now so painful that Bristol Bob refused to allow him
to probe it properly or handle it, so he put fresh
dressings on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bristol Bob now said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose I have long to live, and I had
best spin my yarn to you afore I go. You have
come from an island away to windward, where you
landed after being left adrift in your boat. Isn’t
that so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tom; “and people had been there
before, and one man’s skeleton we buried. Some of
the others had been buried, and the rest had evidently
gone away long before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Bristol Bob, “I’ve been here at Aneitou
now a matter of seven year, and have traded a
bit. But those people who were on that island ran
their boat ashore on Paraka before ever I came here,
and all of them were eaten up; and only because I
have been useful to these people by making trade
for them have I escaped being eaten. Now, listen.
There’s a tidy boat of mine on the island here, and
aboard of her you may go ’most anywheres; and if
you leaves here and steers WSW. by compass—there’s
a compass in my sea-chest—you will, after
about ten days, get to an island called Leviji, where
there are missionaries. You must mind and not land
anywhere before, unless you make out white men
ashore; and even then it’s best not, for many a beach-comber
is as bad as any savage among them. You
will know the missionaries’ island by its having a
mountain with two separate peaks rising up to the
same height in the middle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Tom, “don’t you trouble about
that now. We shall manage for ourselves. But
what can we do for you now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, lad, except give me a drink of water.
My mouth and throat is that parched I can scarce
speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom held a gourd to the sick man’s lips, who
drank eagerly, and then said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, lad. I was even once like you; but my
life has been a sad and bitter one, and now it’s
ending, there’s no hope for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that,” answered Tom. “I ain’t learned
to say much, but one thing I’m certain of, that in the
Bible forgiveness is promised to all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, now? Forgiveness for me? No, lad, I’m
too bad for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” said Tom, and getting the tattered Bible
we had found in the dead man’s hut on Ring Island,
he read to Bristol Bob the glorious promises of the
Christian religion, and also prayed with him, Bill and
I kneeling down with him and joining in the prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we had finished, Bristol Bob said he felt
happier, and trusted that he indeed had found mercy,
and asked again for water to drink. But when Tom
held a pannikin to his mouth, he was seized with a
convulsive shuddering, and dashed it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried to pour some into his mouth, but all our
efforts were fruitless, and we had, after some time, to
give up the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what it is, boys,” said poor Bob. “I’ve
seen a many die from these arrow wounds. I don’t
know what it is, whether it’s the poison of the bone
arrow or what, but it’s an awful death. I may have
a short time during which I can speak, and I will tell
you all I can how to get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor fellow now told us of his magazine, of
his visit to which during the night he had neither
remembrance nor idea, and said that, besides the
powder in the two boxes, we should find some beads
and corals of considerable value, a small bag of pearls,
and about seventy pounds in money. This, he told us,
we could keep for ourselves; and then, as soon as he
was dead, he begged us to bury him out at sea, so
that he could not be dug up and eaten; and that
done, he advised us to get away to Leviji as quick as
we could. He also said that we were to trust none
of the natives, not even Calla, with our plans; but if
we had to employ any one, that it should be Bos’n,
who he said he thought was the best man on the
islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was speaking, he was often interrupted
by convulsive attacks, which at last became so continuous
and so bad that he could no longer talk. Of
the scene of horror that ensued while he was wrestling
with the frightful disease of tetanus, or lockjaw,
I will say nothing—the remembrance of it is even
now too dreadful to me; but when, an hour before
sunset, he died, we all felt that it was a happy
release.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his storeroom we found some canvas and needles,
and as soon as his body was cold, Tom set to work and
sewed him up in a seaman’s shroud, and lashed some
heavy rocks to his feet to sink his body to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before all was ready, the night had nearly passed,
and we lay down to rest for a while, intending, as
soon as we woke, to carry the dead body down to the
<span class='it'>Escape</span>, and, paddling her out into the bay, commit it
to the deep, in accordance with the wishes Bristol Bob
had expressed while still able to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had not slept long before we were awaked by
Calla, who, as soon as the sun had risen, had come
over to the little island with a party of armed men
to insist upon our going over to the mainland to see
his father, Wanga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all said that we would go as soon as we had
buried the dead man, but not before; but Calla said
that we were to come at once, and that the dead body
should be brought along with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this we strongly objected, and when Calla told
some men to take up the body and carry it away,
Tom knocked the foremost of them down. The
others, seeing how their comrade had been treated,
were about to strike at Tom with their tomahawks;
but Bill and I, seizing our muskets, presented them
at Calla, and said that if a single blow were struck
we would shoot him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, too, got his musket, and said that what the
dead man had wished should be carried out, and that
he would die before he was prevented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla, who seemed to have not overmuch heart in
the business, and was, as was afterwards proved, less
of a savage than his countrymen, said something to
them in his own language, on which they sulkily
withdrew, while he tried to prevent our being angry
at what had occurred. He said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sabe Bristol Bob him live along o’ we plenty
long time—seven yam time. Him be all one same
chief, same my fader Wanga. Make plenty one big
bobbery for him die. No kiki he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Calla,” Bob said. “We have to do
as he told us, and we are going to bury him in the
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty much queer white man. No care for man
kiki he. Fish kiki he say plenty good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Calla. We shall do what he said;
and afterwards, if your father wants to see us, we
will come over to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla left us and went away with his men, and we
could see that he had plenty of trouble in controlling
them; and indeed, if he had not been the son of the
great chief of the island, I doubt not that he would
have been unable to do so.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN CAPTIVITY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>s soon as we were left alone we called Bos’n,
who alone of all the men that had lived on
the island was to be seen, the rest, with their wives
and families, having left as soon as they heard of
Bristol Bob’s death; and with his help we carried
the dead man carefully and reverently down to the
boat, and putting off into deep water, launched him
overboard, there to remain till that day when the sea
shall render up her secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom said a short prayer, and then we paddled
back again to the shore. As soon as we landed we
set about preparing the new boat for our voyage,
filling her casks with water, as well as the beakers
from the <span class='it'>Escape</span>, and stowing away all we could think
of as provisions. Fortunately on the islet there were
several bread-fruit trees and a plantation of yams,
and Bos’n, who said he would throw in his lot with
us, collected a quantity of these, and piled them up
alongside the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the casks were filled, Tom said he would
go to the magazine to get the boxes we had seen
there, and that in the meantime Bill and I had better
overhaul the storeroom, and see what was worth
taking away with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the store we found all manner of trade goods—calico,
beads, hatchets, pipes, brass wire, nails, and
other oddments—which might either be useful to or
attract the fancy of the savages, and also a couple of
harpoons and two coils of whale line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We at once took the harpoons and lines down with
us, as well as some fishing-lines and hooks which
were in the dead man’s chest, and the compass, and
then returned for the box with the money and pearls.
When we had stowed these away, Tom came down
with one of the boxes from the magazine, and said
he wanted Bos’n to help him with the other, and told
us to go back and look about the hut for blankets,
knives, cooking-gear, and anything else that might be
useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set about this with a good will, and trotted
backwards and forwards, carrying down all we fancied
would be useful. After a time, when I was in the
hut overhauling the sea-chest, I heard a scream from
Bill, and rushing out, found that he had been seized
by a party of natives, some of whom, when they saw
me, rushed up, and before I had any chance to resist,
threw me on the ground, and lashed my feet together
and my arms by my side, so that it was impossible
to move, and carried me and Bill, who had been
served in a like manner, to a canoe, in which they
had come over from the mainland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were laid on a platform, and some half-dozen
fellows, painted in most hideous patterns, squatted
round, and the canoe was rapidly paddled to the
nearest village on the big island of Aneitou. The
canoe soon reached the shore, and we were carried
up by our captors into the middle of a cleared space
surrounded by some half-dozen native huts, which
were simply long roofs of thatch, open at both ends,
and here we were tied upright to posts planted in the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as we had been placed in this position, a
man came from one of the huts and called out some
orders, and presently from each hut came two men,
bearing a huge wooden drum, the ends of which were
fantastically carved. These drums were placed in a
circle, round the posts to which we were tied, and
then the same man who had given the order for
them to be brought again shouted out commands;
then six men, painted white and red, but stark naked,
came out, each carrying two mallets, with long, elastic
handles, with which they commenced to belabour the
drums in a regular rhythmic cadence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently we heard the sound of distant drums
answering those around us, and soon shouts in the
neighbouring woods added to the noise. How long
this may have gone on I cannot say, for I was in
such pain from the lashings which confined me
cutting into my flesh like red-hot irons, was so
tormented by the rays of the sun beating on my
unprotected head, and in such an agony of parching
thirst that moments seemed like hours; but suddenly
the drummers gave a grand flourish and ceased.
After a moment of intense stillness three beats were
given on each drum, and instantly from the huts and
the woods around armed warriors rushed forth, brandishing
spears and tomahawks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they came crowding round me and my
companion in misfortune, poor Bill, who cried out,
“I say, Sam, d’ye think they’ll eat us alive or kill
us first?”—a question to which I could not give any
answer, for a big fellow was brandishing a tomahawk
close to my eyes, and I was in momentary expectation
of having my brains dashed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some minutes the man who had given the
orders to the drummers called out a few words, and
instantly the noise and confusion ceased, and all the
people drew themselves up in small groups around
the open space, and in front of each group stood a
warrior, who seemed to be a sort of officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the man who gave orders, and who, we
found, was Calla’s father, Wanga, spoke, and the
men in the groups squatted on the ground, while
the officers came and collected round the posts where
we were lashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wanga now called out for Calla, who came out of
one of the huts without arms and guarded by six
men. Wanga now made a long harangue to the
people; and then, turning to Calla, he told him to
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We, of course, could not understand a word, but
afterwards we learned that Wanga had said that we
had done wrong in not giving up the body of Bristol
Bob to Calla, and that he was to blame for not having
insisted on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla defended himself by saying that we had
saved his life from the people of Paraka, and that
it was <span class='it'>tabu</span> to touch a white man who had died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was objected to, and Calla was told that he
should, at all events, have brought us over to the
village; and he was then sent back into the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The posts to which we were lashed were now taken
out of the ground, and with us laid down, while three
fellows, who wore necklaces of finger and toe bones,
and had whistles made out of thigh-bones, came and
danced round us, all the rest of the people remaining
perfectly quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this was going on we heard a dull, smothered
roar as of an explosion, and the dancers, who we
afterwards found were priests or sorcerers, as well as
all the people who were looking on, rushed down to
the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was lying close to Bill, and said, “I wonder what
that is; it sounds like the magazine on Bristol Bob’s
island blown up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” said Bill. “I hope Tom ain’t damaged,
and that these beggars won’t make him prisoner. As
long as he’s free there’s hope for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “we can trust Tom not to desert
us; but I’m afraid he must be a prisoner, and we shall
soon see him here alongside of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had no time to speak any more, for a party
of men came back from the beach, and, under the
direction of the three priests, took us up on their
shoulders, and carried us away at a trot along a
narrow path through the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally our carriers halted to rest or gave
way to others, and sometimes we stopped in the
middle of villages like the one we had been first
taken to, and were exposed to the curiosity of the
women and children (for all the men that were able
had gone down to the muster of the warriors of the
island), and I am bound to say we received no mercy
at their hands. They pinched us, and scratched us,
and tore off our clothes to see if we were white all
over, not caring how they hurt us in doing so, and
pulled out our hair; in fact, they showed themselves
experts in all the petty arts of torture, and if it had
not been that the priests seemed to be somewhat in a
hurry, and never allowed a halt in a village for more
than ten minutes or so, I verily believe we should
have been pinched and scratched to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we arrived at a sort of temple, consisting
of a thatched roof supported on posts which were
rudely fashioned into human figures. In the middle
of this building were two idols, a male and a female,
on which all the art and industry of the people had
been lavished, with a result that combined the grotesque
and the horrible in an extraordinary degree.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes were formed of huge oyster shells
pierced in the middle, and in their grinning mouths
were double lines of boars’ tusks, so that the faces
seemed all eyes and teeth. Large wigs of cocoanut
fibre covered their heads, and round necks, arms, and
legs were strings of beads, shells, and human bones.
In their right hand they held a monster fork, like
that used by their worshippers in their cannibal
feasts, and on these forks and in their left hands
were great pieces of bleeding flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <a id='bones'></a>front of these monstrous and disgusting figures
were piles of bones and skulls, some of which had
hair and flesh still adhering to them. Lamps fed
with cocoanut oil were hanging from the rafters,
and these lamps were made of human skulls; and as
if nothing should be wanting to complete the horror
of the scene, huge pigs were rooting about among the
remains of humanity with which the ground was
strewn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we arrived, the lumps of bleeding flesh were
removed from the left hands of the idols, and we
were hung up in their place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men who had carried us here were now sent
away, and having become <span class='it'>tabu</span> by entering into this
holy place, as it was considered by the people of
Aneitou, they were while there not allowed to mix
with their fellows, but sent to an enclosure reserved
for such purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I and Bill were, it is not too much to say, in a
state of dismal fright and terror, and the lashings by
which we were bound cut into our flesh like bars of
red-hot iron, while our lips were cracked and bleeding,
and we were the victims of a raging thirst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we had hung here for some time, some of
the priests of the temple came and cut us down, and
we expected that we should at once be done to death;
but, after cutting us adrift, they took us a short distance
away into a cave, the entrance to which was
closed with thick balks of timber in which there was
a small gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we were thrust, and water was given us to
drink, and the gate being securely barred on the outside,
we were left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We instantly relieved our parching thirst, and then
set to work to rub each other to ease the pain caused
by the lashings which had bound us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time we felt more at ease, and began to
consider what would become of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect they will kill and eat us,” said Bill; “but
surely we can find some way to escape. I would
Tom were here; he’d know what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid Tom must be a prisoner or dead; but,
anyway, let us search round this place, and find if
there is any way out. If we could get out, and get
to the beach, and steal a canoe, we might have a
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set to work to examine the entrance to the
cave; but the gate and the balks of timber in which
it was set were too strong to give us any hope of
being able to break through them, so we soon gave
up and began to explore the cave itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went in several directions, and found dark
holes and passages, into which we crept; but one
and all came to an end before we had proceeded
far, until we reached the very last, which was
only about three feet high at the entrance, but
which we found after a time grew lighter and
higher, and at last became a large cave, lighted by
a small hole near the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this hole we tried to climb; but the rock had
been cut away all around it, so that it was perfectly
inaccessible, although by the natural roughness of the
sides of the cave it was easy to climb up to the roof
everywhere else. Opposite the hole, but some fifteen
feet from it, was a sort of shelf; and to this we scrambled,
so as to look out, and we saw right opposite us
the bay in which was Bristol Bob’s island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The island itself we could also see, and the hillock
and trees under which the magazine was were blown
up, and several of the huts were destroyed, but the
dock where the cutter was laid up we could not see,
so that we could not make out whether she were safe
or not. Our old <span class='it'>Escape</span> we saw with some men in
her, evidently taking her to Wanga’s village, but on
the island there was not a soul to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat some time on the shelf trying to get some
idea into our heads as to how the hole could be reached,
and at last we got down and determined to return to
the part of the cave where we had been left by our
jailers; but first we looked round where we were,
and in one corner we found a pool of fresh water,
which was a source of gladness to both of us, for at
all events we could make sure of not dying of thirst,
and also have a good wash whenever the fancy took
us; and take us it did then and there, for we were
very dirty and sore, and a bathe did us all the good
imaginable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we got back to the front cave we found that
it had not been visited since we left; but before we
had been there ten minutes the gate was unbarred,
and a plentiful supply of food—fish, pork, yams, bread-fruit,
and bananas—was brought to us, and it was
signed to us that we should eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were both hungry, and fell to on the good things
provided for us with a hearty appetite, till, suddenly,
Bill stopped eating, and said, “I say, mate, they wants
to fatten us up to eat us. I don’t fancy being stuffed
like a turkey in a coop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea took away my appetite at once, and not
another mouthful could I swallow; but, nevertheless,
we determined to hide the food away, with the idea that,
if the priests found us apparently eating enormously,
and yet getting thinner and thinner, they would come
to the conclusion that we were worthless for fattening
purposes, and would give up the intention,
and perchance let us go free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly the remnants of our repast were stowed
away in one of the small side caves, and it now being
night, Bill and I, huddling together for warmth, lay
down to sleep.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A DIVE FOR LIBERTY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>ur sleep was broken and disturbed by the
noise of drums in the temple, and again and
again we woke with a start, and thought that some
one had come to call us out to be offered up before
the hideous idols, and as often found that our alarm
was only caused by a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the middle of the night the noise outside ceased,
and we both being thoroughly wearied out, slept
soundly. All at once I was awaked by feeling cold,
wet hands on my throat and mouth, and struggled to
free myself and shout out; while Bill, roused by my
struggles, grunted out, “What’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice said, “No make bobbery. Be plenty quiet.
Me be Calla come make good for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently some one was watching, for we heard
people outside speaking, and the noise of the gate
being unbarred. While this was doing, Calla stole
noiselessly away; and when one of the priests of the
temple came in, bearing a great, flaming torch of
palm leaves, and searched about the cave, he could
only find me and Bill; so, giving us a couple of kicks
apiece, he went back and fastened the gate again,
evidently displeased at being disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he had gone and all was again quiet,
Bill and I whispered together, wondering where Calla
had come from, and where he had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it,” I said, almost forgetting the necessity
for speaking low, but remembering myself in time.
“Calla was wet; he must have come by the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could he?” answered Bill. “There’s no
passage there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” I said; “that’s where he came from.
Let’s get down there, and see what we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To get to the pool in the dark was easier said than
done; but at last we found our way to the part of the
cave where it was, which was dimly lighted by the
hole in the side through which we had seen Bristol
Bob’s island, and we groped about to try to find
some way by which Calla could have got in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst we were thus engaged, we heard a long-drawn
breath, and then a rippling in the pool, and
then we distinguished a dark form coming to its
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist! hist! me Calla,” he said as he emerged;
and we hurried to him and asked what he wanted,
and what was the news of Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Tom he live plenty good. But now one
time make go. Dem other men no catch. Know
eberyting. Me sabe dis hole no shut below—one
time easy go and come—make people tink plenty
ting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently Calla had dived in from the outside, and
if we could manage to dive as well, we might make
our way out of our prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla proposed that we should dive down, and gave
us the direction we were to swim in; and Bill, who
was a capital swimmer and diver, according to European
standards, slipped fearlessly into the pool, and
taking a long breath sank below its surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dive, however, was beyond his capabilities, for
he soon reappeared puffing and blowing, and declared
that he could not possibly manage it; and when he
had rested a bit, he told me he had gone down and
down into a sort of passage, where he could feel the
rock on either side of him, when he felt as if he
would burst, and could endure it no longer, so he
had given himself a shove backwards, and returned
to the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No be far,” said Calla; “see me go and come back
one time;” and suiting the action to the word he
glided down through the water, and in about four
minutes returned with a handful of grass which he
said he had plucked on the outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill, encouraged by this, made another attempt, but
like ill success attended it; and as for me, I knew that
if Bill could not dive out, it was hopeless to think of
my being able to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla at first seemed very much annoyed; but after
a bit he said, “Me sabey,” and dived out of the cave, and
soon returned bringing with him a line of cocoanut
fibre, and made us understand that he would haul us
through the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be dragged through an underground drain at
the end of a rope was a nervous piece of work, but to
remain where we were meant danger and captivity;
whilst on the other side of the passage was freedom
and comparative safety, if Calla was to be trusted,
and we did not take long to make up our minds to
consent to his proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little discussion, Bill and I settled that he
should be the first to go; and he promised, if he got
through safe, to tie a peculiar knot in the end of the
line to show me that he was all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not take long in securing the line to Bill,
and then Calla took the other end in his teeth, and
the two together disappeared below the surface. I
waited and waited for Calla to come back, and the
time seemed intensely long before he again was with
me with the piece of line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I anxiously examined the end for Bill’s knot, and
when I felt it and learned that he was safely out of
the cave, my joy was great, though I was still in a
great fright as to what would happen to me. Calla
secured the line round, me, so that I could not struggle,
and telling me to keep my mouth shut, put me in the
pool. I felt myself sinking, and then being dragged
along, touching rock sometimes above, sometimes
below, and sometimes on either side of me; and I felt
as if the drums of my ears would be broken in, and
a sense of oppression on my chest which was almost
intolerable. I thought that I would be constrained
to open my mouth and shout, and I know that if my
limbs had been at liberty I should have struck out,
and would have added much to the difficulty of the
task Calla had set himself; but just when I could
have endured no longer, I felt myself emerge from the
water, and was dragged to the bank by Bill and Calla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I blew like a porpoise while my lashing was being
undone; and when I had got some breath in my body
again, Calla told Bill and me to follow him, and that
he would lead us to where Tom was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hurried along narrow paths, through tangled
woods, and in a very short time arrived at the shores
of the bay in which Bristol Bob’s island was. Here
we found a canoe, into which we got, and paddled off
stealthily to the island, where we found Tom safe
and sound, and Bristol Bob’s little craft prepared for
sea, and Bos’n with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I longed to ask him what had happened since we
were parted; but Calla was urgent that we should get
to sea at once, and run down to some islands where he
said “missionary men” lived. And as we had to keep
a good lookout for fear of being pursued, and then
all of us were so tired, we agreed to sleep in turns,
and when we were all rested to communicate our
different adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we were all rested and awake, the island
where we had been prisoners had almost faded out
of view, and we were safe from pursuit, and running
before a steady trade wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, mates,” said Tom, “I think we have all to
thank Calla for saving us, as without him we could
have done nothing, and I vote he tells us first how he
came to help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla very shortly told us that we had saved his
life, and that he thought it therefore belonged to us;
and when his father came to where he was kept
prisoner, and provided him with means of escaping,
lest he should be killed, he first of all went to Bristol
Bob’s island, which, after the explosion we had heard
(which was indeed the magazine, and which had
killed four men), had been <span class='it'>tabu</span>, where he found
Tom and Bos’n, and told them to get the boat ready,
while he went himself and got Bill and me out
of our prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his story was told, Tom insisted on hearing
what had happened to Bill and myself; and having
been satisfied, he narrated his own adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, mates, I was away in the magazine when
you was carried off, and knowing as I could do nothing,
I kept low for a bit, and hid behind some bushes,
so as to keep a lookout on what happened. After
some time I saw some fellows, who had been hunting
all over the island, and several times came nigh on
finding me, had made out the whereabouts of the
magazine, and got some torches to go down into it,
and almost directly I heard the place blow up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their mates seemed to be pretty well frightened,
and didn’t wait many minutes nor look for their
chums, but bolted to their canoes, and paddled away
to the big island for dear life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a bit two big canoes came and paddled round
with drums, and a man in one of them shouted out
something, and among what he said I could make out
‘tabu, tabu,’ being repeated several times, and then
they went away again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When night came, I set to work to get the boat
ready if possible; and presently Bos’n, who had been
hiding, came to me and helped. Calla came after a
while, and told us he would fetch you; and that’s the
end of it, till you came along of him, and we started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our adventures were now almost over, for the next
day we fell in with the missionary schooner <span class='it'>Dayspring</span>,
and the missionaries took care of us, and took
us to their headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we came to overhaul the things we had
brought away with us in Bristol Bob’s boat, we
found that the money and pearls were worth over
four thousand pounds, which we divided into four
lots, one for each of us, and one for Calla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calla said he would now become a “missionary
man;” and he, after careful instruction, became a Christian,
and lived for many years happy and respected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Arbor also became a “missionary man,”
shipping in the <span class='it'>Dayspring</span>, as did the faithful Bos’n,
and had risen to be her mate when he met with his
death at the hands of savages, to whom he was trying
to take the message of peace, and added his name to
the list of those martyrs who have sacrificed their lives
in the cause of Christianity in the Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill and I, by the advice of the missionaries, went
home, and were bound apprentices on board a fine
Indiaman, and we both made rapid progress. We
always sailed together till Bill’s death. He lost his
life in attempting to save a shipwrecked crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the <span class='it'>Golden Fleece</span> and her crew we never heard,
and her fate is one of the mysteries of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, I have been fortunate and prosperous;
and now, after having for some years commanded my
own ship, I have settled down to pass the evening of
my days in peace and quietness, full of thankfulness
for the mercies which have been vouchsafed to me.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
